captain of a team, against the dimensions of an opponent’s stick, that opponent must be on the ice at the time the request is made to the referee. once the request is made, and as long as the officials maintain visual contact with the stick, it can be measured. this means that if the player whose stick is about to be measured steps off the ice onto his players’ bench, his stick may still be measured provided the request was received prior to him leaving the ice surface and the stick remains in the view of at least one of the on -ice officials. the referee shall take the stick t o the penalty bench where the necessary measurement shall be made immediately. players on bothsection 3 - equipment national hockey league official rules 2021-2022 17 teams shall retire to their respective benches. to measure the curvature of the blade of the stick, the referee must draw an imaginary line along the outside of the shaft to the bottom of the blade and then along the bottom of the blade - this will determine the location of the heel. using a league-approved measuring gauge, the referee shall secure the gauge at the heel of the stick and measure the curvature of the blade from the heel to any point along the toe of the blade. to measure any other dimension of the stick, the referee shall use a measuring tape. the result shall be reported to the penalty timekeeper, who shall record it on the back of the penalty record form. the referee will convey the result of the measurement to the captain or alternate captain of the team whose stick was measured. if the stick proves to be

account for the purpose of the delayed penalty rule (rule 26 – delayed penalties ). this rule only applies when at least one team is already serving a time penalty in the penalty box that causes them to be short- handed. when one minor penalty is assessed to one player of each team at the same stoppage in play, these penalties will be served without substitution provided there are no other

is also applicable when coincidental penalties are negated, leaving the aforementioned examples. in such instances, the team of the player receiving the major penalty must place the replacement player in the penalty bench prior to expiration of the penalty. in the case of a match penalty, the team must place the replacement player in the penalty bench immediately. the differential will be recorded on the penalty clock as a three (3) minute or a one (1) minute penalty (as applicable), and served in the same manner as a major penalty. this rule shall be applied regardless as to the on -ice strength of the two teams at the time the above outlined penaltie s are assessed. 19.5 applying the coincidental penalty rule –when multiple penalties are assessed to both teams at the same stoppage of play, the following rules are to be utilized by the referees to determine the on - ice strength for both teams: (i) cancel as many major and/or match penalties as possible (ii) cancel as many minor, bench minor and or double -minor penalties as possible refe r to reference tables -table 15 –coincidental penalties on page 1 51.section 4 –types of penalties national hockey league official

their one minor penalty, this rule shall apply and the teams would still play four skaters against four skaters (the player incurring the misconduct penalty would have to serve the entire 12 minutes –minor plus misconduct –and his team would have to place an additional player on the penalty bench to serve the minor penalty and be able to return to the ice when the minor penalty expires). when multiple penalties are assessed to both teams, equal numbers of minor and major penalties shall be eliminated using the coincident alpenalty rule and any differential in time penalties shall be served

where this standard is met, the goal will be disallowed. the standard for overturning the call in the event of a “ no goal” call on the ice is that the nhl situation room, after reviewing any and all replays and consulting with the onice official(s), determines that the goal on the ice should have been allowed because either: (i) there section 5 – officials national hockey league official rules 2021-2022 68 was no actual contact of any kind initiated by the attacking player with the goalkeeper; or (ii) the attacking player was pushed, shoved or fouled by the defending player causing the attacking player to come into contact with the goalkeeper; or (iii) the attacking player’s positioning within the crease did not impair the goalkeeper’s ability to defend his goal and, in fact, had no discernable impact on the play;

does not return to the ice from the penalty bench (see 68.2), or when a player illegally enters the game for the sole purpose of preventing an opposing player from scoring on a breakaway (see 68.3 and 68.4). when an injured player is penalized and leaves the game, if he returns before the expiration of his penalty, he is not eligible to play. this includes coincidental penalties when his substitute

allowed. goals should be disallowed only if: (1) an attacking player, either by his positioning or by contact, impairs the goalkeeper’s ability to move freely within his crease or defend his goal; or (2) an attacking player initiates intentional or deliber atecontact with a goalkeeper, inside or outside of his goal crease. incidental contact with a goalkeeper will be permitted, and resulting goals

the ability to m ove freely within his goal crease without being hindered by the actions of an attacking player. if an attacking player enters the goal crease and, by his actions, impairs the goalkeeper’s ability to defend his goal, and a goal is scored, the goal will be disallowed. if an attacking player has been pushed, shoved, or fouled by a defending player so as to cause him to come into contact with the goalkeeper, such contact will not be deemed contact initiated by the attacking player for purposes of this rule, pro vided the attacking player has made a reasonable effort to avoid such contact. if a defending player has been pushed, shoved, or fouled by an attacking player so as to cause the defending player to come into contact with his own goalkeeper, such contact sh all be deemed contact initiated by the attacking player for purposes of this rule, and if necessary a penalty assessed to the attacking player and if a goal is scored it would be disallowed.

of the goalkeeper at the time of the contact. 69.3 contact inside the goal crease - if an attacking player initiates contact with a goalkeeper, incidental or otherwise, while the goalkeeper is in his goal crease, and a goal is scored, the goal will be disallowed. if a goalkeeper, in the act of establishing his position within his goal crease, initiates contact with an attacking player who i s in

scored, the goal will be disallowed. in all such cases, whether or not a goal is scored, the attacking player will receive a minor penalty for goalkeeper interference. if an attacking player establishes a significant position within the goal crease, so as to obstruct the goalkeeper’s vision and impair his ability to defend his goal, and a goal is scored, the go al will be disallowed. for this purpose, a player “establishes a significant position within the crease” when, in the referee’s judgment, his body, or a substantial portion thereof, is within the goal crease for more than an

off spot and must remain there until the puck is dropped. failure to comply with this positioning and face -off procedure will result in a face -off violation. whene ver a team has committed two face -off violations during the same face -off, the referee shall immediately assess the offending team a bench minor penalty for delay of game. this penalty shall be announced as a “bench minor penalty for delay of game –face -off violation.” players who are late to the face -off location and therefore in an off - side position for the ensuing face -off will be warned once in the game by the referee. this warning will also be given to the offending team’s coach. in this situation, t he offending team’s center is not ejected from the face -off. any subsequent violation shall result in a bench minor penalty for delay of game being assessed to the offending team. this penalty shall be announced as a “bench minor penalty for delay of game –slow proceeding to face -off location.” in the conduct of any face -off at any of the nine (9) face -off spots on the playing surface, no player facing -off shall make any physical contact with his opponent’s body by means of his own body or by his stick ex cept in the course of playing the puck after the face -off has been completed. for violation of this rule, the referee may, at his discretion impose a minor penalty or penalties on the player(s) whose action(s) caused the physical contact. nonetheless, this physical contact prior to the dropping of the puck shall be deemed as a face -off violation and the linesman shall order the center of the offending team replaced. face -off encroachment may be applied during face -offs at any of the nine (9) face -off spots on the playing surface. however, since no such lines are painted on the ice at the four (4) face -off spots adjacent to the blue lines, linesmen shall use their judgment as to whether or not a violation has occurred. all players, other than the centers, sha ll be uniformly back from the face -off location similar to being outside the face -off circle for face -offs in the end zones. 76.7line changes –no substitution of players shall be permitted until the face-off has been completed and play has resumed excep t when a penalty is imposed which affects the on -ice strength of either team. should an on -ice official notice that the defending team has not placed enough players on the ice for the ensuing face -off, the referee in the neutral zone shall be notified and he will instruct the offending team to place another player(s) on the ice. if, in the opinion of the referee that this is being done as a stalling tactic, he will issue a warning to the offending team’s coach and any subsequent violations section 10 –game flow national hockey league official rules 20 21-2022 11676.5procedure –other players –no other player shall be allowed to enter the face-off circle or come within fifteen feet (15') of the players facing -off. all players must stand on -side on all face -offs. during end -zone face -offs, all other players on the ice must position their bodies on their own side of the restraining lines mar ked on the outer edge of the face -off circles. if a player other than the player taking the face -off moves into the face-off circle prior to the dropping of the puck, then the offending team’s player taking the face -off shall be ejected from the face -off circle. this shall be considered a face -off violation. players on the attacking team (exclusive of the center) must establish their position first and then the defending team may counter and hold its position until the puck is dropped. a violation of this procedure shall be treated as face -off encroachment and the linesman shall order the center of the offending team replaced. should an attacking player attempt to establish a new position prior to the face -off, and the defending center steps back from the fa ce-off spot in order to reposition his teammates, the face -off violation shall be charged to the attacking team as they must establish their position first. 76.6 violations –if a center should move prematurely prior to the face -off, or if the referee or linesman shall have dropped the puck unfairly, the face -off shall be considered a face -off violation and it must be conducted again. when a least two face -off violations have been committed by the same team during the same face -off, this team shall be pena lized with a bench minor penalty to the offending team. this penalty shall be announced as a “bench minor penalty for delay of game –face -off violation.” face -off violations shall be summarized as follows (any of the four on-ice officials may identify a face -off violation): (i) encroachment by any player other than the center into the face -off area prior to the puck being dropped. players on the perimeter of the face-off circle must keep both skates outside the face -off circle (skate contact with t he line is permitted). if a player's skate crosses the line into the face -off circle prior to the drop of the puck, this shall be deemed as a face -off violation. a player's stick may be inside the face-off circle provided there is no physical contact with his opponent or his opponent's stick. (ii) encroachment by any player into the area between the hash marks on the outer edges of the face -off circle prior to the puck being dropped. players must also ensure that both of their skates do not cross their respecti ve hash marks. contact with the line with their skate is permitted. if a player's skate crosses the line into the area between the hash marks prior to the drop of the puck, this shall be deemed as a face -off violation. a player's stick may be inside the area between the hash marks provided there is no physical contact with his opponent or his opponent's stick.

(regular season and playoffs), hockey operations will initiate the review of any scenario that would otherwise be subject to a coach’s challenge. hockey operations will continue to initiate and be responsible for the re view of all goals subject to video review under rule 37.3. where a coach’s challenge is available on a scoring play potentially section 10 – game flow national hockey league official rules 20 21-2022 121 involving “interference on the goalkeeper” , “missed game stoppage event in the offensive zone leading to a goal”, or “off-side,” hockey operations will, as an initial and threshold matter, determine that the puck entered the net and is a good hockey goal before the play will be subject to further review by means of a coach’s challenge (or, in the final minute of play or in overtime, a review initiated by hockey operations). if a team requests a coach’s challenge but video review under rule 37.3 renders such challenge unnecessary, then the challenge will be deemed not to have been made. rule 79 – hand pass 79.1 hand pass - a player shall be permitted to stop or “bat” a puck in the air with his open hand, or push it along the ice with his hand, and the play shall not be stopped unless, in the opinion of the on- ice officials, he has directed the puck to a teammate, or has allowed his team to gain an advantage, and subsequently possession and control of the puck is obtained by a player of the offending team, either directly or deflected off any player or official. for violations related to “closing his hand on the puck”, refer to rule 67 – handling puck. 79.2 defending zone - play will not be stopped for any hand pass by players in their own defending zone. the location of the puck when contacted by either the player making the hand pass or the player receiving the hand pass shall determine the zone it is in. 79.3 face-off location – when a hand pass violation has occurred, the ensuing face-off shall take place at the nearest face-off spot in the zone where the offense occurred, unless the offending team gains a territorial advantage, then the face-off shall be at t he nearest face -off spot in the zone where the stoppage of play occurred, unless otherwise covered in the rules. when a hand pass violation occurs by a team in their attacking zone, the ensuing face-off shall be conducted at one of the face- off spots outsi de the defending team’s blue line in the neutral zone. rule 80 – high-sticking the puck 80.1 high-sticking the puck – for infractions involving high-sticks, refer to rule 60 – high-sticking. batting the puck above the normal height of the shoulders with a stick is prohibited. when a puck is struck with a high stick and subsequently comes into the possession and control of a player from the offending team (including the player who made contact with the puck), either directly or deflected off any player or official, there shall be a whistle. when a puck has been contacted by a high stick, the play shall be permitted to continue, provided that: (i) the puck has been batted to an opponent (when a play er bats the puck to an opponent, the referee shall give the “washout” signal immediately. otherwise, he will stop the play). section 10 – game flow national hockey league official rules 20 21-2022 122 (ii) a player of the defending side shall bat the puck into his own goal in which case the goal shall be allowed. cradling the puck on the blade of the stick (like lacrosse) above the normal height of the shoulders shall be prohibited and a stoppage of play shall result. if this is done by a player on a penalty shot or shootout attempt, the shot shall be stopped immediately and considered complete. 80.2 face-off location - when the play is stopped for the high-sticking the puck violation, the ensuing face-off must take place at the spot that provides the least amount of territorial advantage to the team striking the puck, either where the puck was contacted illegally, or where it was last played by the offending team. if the attacking team is at fault and the play is stopped while the puck is in the attacking zone, the ensuing face-off must be moved to the nearest face- off spot in the neut ral zone. 80.3 disallowed goal – when an attacking player causes the puck to enter the opponent’s goal by contacting the puck above the height of the crossbar, either directly or deflected off any player or official, the goal shall not be allowed. the determining factor is where the puck makes contact with the stick. if the puck makes contact with the stick at or below the level of the crossbar and enters the goal, this goal shall be allowed. a goal scored as a result of a defending player striking the puck with his stick carried above the height of the crossbar of the goal frame into his own goal shall be allowed. rule 81 – icing 81.1 icing – for the purpose of this rule, the center red line will divide the ice into halves. should any player of a team, equal or superior in numerical strength (power -play) to the opposing team, shoot, bat or deflect the puck from his own half of the ice beyond the goal line of the opposing team, play shall be stopped. for the purpose of deflected pucks, this only applies when the puck was originally propelled down the ice by the offending team. for the purpose of this rule, the point of last contact with the puck by the team in possession shall be used to determine whether icing has occurred or not. as such, the team in possession must “gain the line” in order for the icing to be nullified. “gaining the line” shall mean that the puck, while on the player’s stick (not the player’s skate) must make contact with the center red line in order to nullify a potential icing. for the purpose of interpretation of the rule, there are two judgments required for "icing the puck". the linesman must first determine that the puck will cross the goal line. once the linesman determines that the puck will cross the goal line, icing is completed upon the determination as to which player (attacking or defending) would first touch the puck. this decision by the linesman will be made by no later than the instant the first player reaches the end zone face- off dots with the player's skate being the determining factor. should section 10 –game flow national hockey league official rules 20 21-2022 123the puck be shot down the ice in such a manner that it travels around the boards and/or back towards the end zone face-off dots, the same procedure shall be in effect in that the linesman shall determine within a similar distance as to who will have touched the puck first. for clarification, the determining factor is which player would first touch the puck, not which player would first reach the end zone face - off dots. if the race for the puck is too close to determine by the time the first player reach esthe end zone face -off dots, icing shall be called. the puck striking or deflecting off an official does not automatically nullify a potential icing. 81.2 face -off location –following an icing, the attacking team will have the choice of which end zone dot the face -off will take place. if, in the opinion of the referee, the defending side intentionally abstains from playing the puck promptly when they are in a position to do so, he shall stop the play and order the resulting face -off on the adjacent corner face -off spot nearest the goal of the team at fault. if the linesman shall have erred in calling an “icing the puck” infraction (regardless of whether either team is short -handed), the puck shall be faced -off on the center ice face -off spot. 81.3 goalkeeper -if, in the opinion of the linesman, the goalkeeper feigns playing the puck, attempts to play the puck, or skates in the direction of the puck on an icing at any time, the potential icing shall not be called and play shall continue. if, however, a goalkeeper is legitimately out of the crease in an attempt to go t o the players’ bench to be substituted for an extra attacker and in no way makes an attempt to play the puck, the icing should not be nullified under this section. if the goalkeeper is out of his crease prior to the shot being taken, and simply retreats to his crease making no attempt to play the puck or feign playing the puck, the potential icing shall remain in effect. 81.4 line change on icing -a team that is in violation of this rule shall not be permitted to make any player substitutions prior to the ensu ing face-off. however, a team shall be permitted to make a player substitution to replace a goalkeeper who had been substituted for an extra attacker, to replace an injured player, or when a penalty has been assessed which affects the on -ice strength of ei ther team. the determination of players on ice will be made when the puck leaves the offending player’s stick. 81.5 no icing –when the puck is shot and rebounds from the body or stick of an opponent in his own half of the ice so as to cross the goal line of the player shooting, it shall not be considered “icing.” when a puck is shot by a team from their own half of the ice and is deflected several times before crossing the center red line, icing shall be nullified if at least one of these deflections was off an opposing player. if the puck shall go beyond the goal line in the opposite half of the ice directly from either of the players while facing -off, it shall not besection 10 –game flow national hockey league official rules 20 21-2022 122(ii) a player of the defending side shall bat the puck into his own goal in which case the goal shall be allowed. cradling the puck on t he blade of the stick (like lacrosse) above the normal height of the shoulders shall be prohibited and a stoppage of play shall result. if this is done by a player on a penalty shot or shootout attempt, the shot shall be stopped immediately and considered complete. 80.2 face -off location -when the play is stopped for the high -sticking the puck violation, the ensuing face -off must take place at the spot that provides the least amount of territorial advantage to the team striking the puck, either where the puck was contacted illegally, or where it was last played by the offending team. if the attacking team is at fault and the play is stopped while the puck is in the attacking zone, the ensuing face -off must be moved to the nearest face -off spot in the neut ral zone. 80.3 disallowed goal –when an attacking player causes the puck to enter the opponent’s goal by contacting the puck above the height of the crossbar, either directly or deflected off any player or official, the goal shall not be allowed. the determini ng factor is where the puck makes contact with the stick. if the puck makes contact with the stick at or below the level of the crossbar and enters the goal, this goal shall be allowed. a goal scored as a result of a defending player striking the puck withhis stick carried above the height of the crossbar of the goal frame into his own goal shall be allowed. rule 81–icing 81.1 icing –for the purpose of this rule, the center red line will divide the ice into halves. should any player of a team, equal or superior in numerical strength (power -play) to the opposing team, shoot, bat or deflect the puck from his own half of the ice beyond the goal line of the opposing team, play shall be stopped. for the purpose of deflected pucks, this only applies when the puck was originally propelled down the ice by the offending team. for the purpose of this rule, the point of last contact with the puck by the team in possession shall be used to determine whether icing has occurred or not. as such, the team in possession must “gain the line” in order for the icing to be nullified. “gaining the line” shall mean that the puck, while on the player’s st ick (not the player’s skate) must make contact with the center red line in order to nullify a potential icing. for the purpose of interpretation of the rule, there are two judgments required for "icing the puck". the linesman must first determine that the puck will cross the goal line. once the linesman determines that the puck will cross the goal line, icing is completed upon the determination as to which player (attacking or defending) would first touch the puck. this decision by the linesman will be made by no later than the instant the first player reaches the end zone face - off dots with the player's skate being the determining factor. should section 10 – game flow national hockey league official rules 20 21-2022 123 the puck be shot down the ice in such a manner that it travels around the boards and/or back towards the end zone face- off dots, the same procedure shall be in effect in that the linesman shall determine within a similar distance as to who will have touched the puck first. for clarification, the determining factor is which player would first touch the puck, not which player would first reach the end zone face- off dots. if the race for the puck is too close to determine by the time the first player reach es the end zone face-off dots, icing shall be called. the puck striking or deflecting off an official does not automatically nullify a potential icing. 81.2 face-off location – following an icing, the attacking team will have the choice of which end zone dot the face-off will take place. if, in the opinion of the referee, the defending side intentionally abstains from playing the puck promptly when they are in a position to do so, he shall stop the play and order the resulting face- off on the adjacent corner face-off spot nearest the goal of the team at fault. if the linesman shall have erred in calling an “icing the puck” infraction (regardless of whether either team is short-handed), the puck shall be faced-off on the center ice face- off spot. 81.3 goalkeeper - if, in the opinion of the linesman, the goalkeeper feigns playing the puck, attempts to play the puck, or skates in the direction of the puck on an icing at any time, the potential icing shall not be called and play shall continue. if, however, a goalkeeper is legitimately out of the crease in an attempt to go to the players’ bench to be substituted for an extra attacker and in no way makes an attempt to play the puck, the icing should not be nullified under this section. if the goalkeeper is out of his crease prior to the shot being taken, and simply retreats to his crease making no attempt to play the puck or feign playing the puck, the potential icing shall remain in effect. 81.4 line change on icing - a team that is in violation of this rule shall not be permitted to make any player substitutions prior to the ensuing face-off. however, a team shall be permitted to make a player substitution to replace a goalkeeper who had been substituted for an extra attacker, to replace an injured player, or when a penalty has been assessed which affects the on-ice strength of either team. the determination of players on ice will be made when the puck leaves the offending player’s stick. 81.5 no icing – when the puck is shot and rebounds from the body or stick of an opponent in his own half of the ice so as to cross the goal line of the player shooting, it shall not be considered “icing.” when a puck is shot by a team from their own half of the ice and is deflected several times before crossing the center red line, icing shall be nullified if at least one of these deflections was off an opposing player. if the puck shall go beyond the goal line in the opposite half of the ice directly from either of the players while facing-off, it shall not be section 10 – game flow national hockey league official rules 20 21-2022 124 considered a violation of this rule. if, in the opinion of the linesman, any player (other than the goalkeeper) of the opposing team is able to play the puck before it passes his goal line, but has not done so, play shall continue and the icing violation shall not be called. this includes the situation whereby the opposing team, while in the process of making player substitutions during the play, are able to play the puck, but choose not to do so to avoid being called for too many men on the ice. icing should not be called. if the puck touches any part of a player of the opposing side, including his skates or his stick, or if it touches any part of the opposing team’s goalkeeper, including his skates or his stick, at any time before or after crossing the goal line, it shall not be considered icing. if a goalkeeper takes any action to dislodge the puck from the back of the net, icing shall not be called. 81.6 numerical strength – if the puck was so shot by a player of a side below the numerical strength of the opposing team, play shall continue and the icing violation shall not be called. when a team is “short-handed” as the result of a penalty and the penalty is about to expire, the decision as to whether there has been an “icing” shall be determined at the instant the penalty expires. should the puck be released from the stick of the player shooting the puck down the ice prior to the penalty expiring, the icing infraction shall not apply. the action of the penalized player remaining in the penalty box will not alter the ruling. when a team is “short-handed” by reason of a major penalty, and they have neg lected to ensure there is a player on the penalty bench to exit upon the expiry of the penalty, they will continue to play short-handed but are not permitted to ice the puck. icing will be called. they may substitute for this penalized player at the next s toppage of play. see rule 20.3 – major penalties. rule 82 – line changes 82.1 line change - following the stoppage of play, the visiting team shall promptly place a line -up on the ice ready for play and no substitution shall be made from that time until play has been resumed. the home team may then make any desired substitution, except in case s following an icing, which does not result in the delay of the game. “placing a line-up on the ice” shall mean that both teams shall place the full complement of players (and not exceed) to which they are entitled within the line change time frame. if the re is any undue delay by either team in changing players, the referee shall order the offending team or teams to take their positions immediately and not permit any further player changes. when a substitution has been made under the above rule, no additional substitution may be made until play commences. section 10 –game flow national hockey league official rules 20 21-2022 125once the line change procedure has been completed ( 82.2), no additional player substitutions shall be permitted until the face -off has been completed legally and play has resumed, except when a penalty or penalties are imposed that affect the on -ice strength of either or both teams. this may include penalties imposed following the completion of the line change and prior to the face -off, or due to a penalty assessed for a face -off violation. a team that is i n violation of rule 63.8 –delaying the game or rule 81–icing shall not be permitted to make any player substitutions prior to the ensuing face -off. however, a team shall be permitted to make a player substitution to replace a goalkeeper who had been substituted for an extra attacker, to replace an injured p layer, or when a penalty has been assessed which affects the on -ice strength of either team. the determination of players on ice will be made when the puck leaves the offending player’s stick. goalkeepers’ substitution during a game will be conducted withi n the same time frame as a regular line change. no extra time will be allotted to the goalkeeper coming off the bench, except in the case where an injury to a goalkeeper occurs. 82.2procedure -following a stoppage of play, the referee will enforce the following line change procedure once he has determined that this procedure may begin: (i) the referee shall give the visiting team up to five (5) seconds to make its line change. (ii) the referee shall raise his hand to indicate no further changes by the visiting te am and to commence the home team’s line change. (iii) the referee shall give the home team up to eight (8) seconds to make its line change. (iv) the referee shall lower his hand to indicate no further changes by the home team. (v) any attempt by the either team to make a change after the referee’s signal, attempt to place too many men on the ice for the subsequent line change, or attempt to make additional personnel changes, shall not be permitted and the referee will send the players who have attempted to change back to their players’ bench. the referee will then issue a warning to the offending team (through the coach) indicating that any subsequent violations during the rest of the game (including overtime), shall result in a bench minor penalty for delaying the game. t his penalty shall be announced as a “bench minor penalty for delay of game –improper line change.” (vi) the linesman conducting the face -off will blow his whistle (once the referee has lowered his hand for the line changes) to indicate that all players must be in position and on -side for the face -off within five (5) seconds. the face -off will then be conducted in accordance with rule 76 –face -offs. (vii) players who are slow (after the five -second warning whistle given by the linesman) getting to the face -off locati on or who are in an off -side position for the ensuing face -off will be warned once in the game by the referee. this warning will also be given to the offending team’s coach. in this situation, the offending team’s center is not ejected from the face -off. any subsequent violation shall result in a bench minor penalty for delay of game being assessed to the offending section 10 –game flow national hockey league official rules 20 21-2022 124considered a violation of this rule. if, in the opinion of the linesman, any player (other tha n the goalkeeper) of the opposing team is able to play the puck before it passes his goal line, but has not done so, play shall continue and the icing violation shall not be called. this includes the situation whereby the opposing team, while in the proces s of making player substitutions during the play, are able to play the puck, but choose not to do so to avoid being called for too many men on the ice. icing should not be called. if the puck touches any part of a player of the opposing side, including hi s skates or his stick, or if it touches any part of the opposing team’s goalkeeper, including his skates or his stick, at any time before or after crossing the goal line, it shall not be considered icing. if a goalkeeper takes any action to dislodge the pu ck from the back of the net, icing shall not be called. 81.6 numerical strength –if the puck was so shot by a player of a side below the numerical strength of the opposing team, play shall continue and the icing violation shall not be called. when a team is “s hort-handed” as the result of a penalty and the penalty is about to expire, the decision as to whether there has been an “icing” shall be determined at the instant the penalty expires. should the puck be released from the stick of the player shooting the puck down the ice prior to the penalty expiring, the icing infraction shall not apply. the action of the penalized player remaining in the penalty box will not alter the ruling. when a team is “short -handed” by reason of a major penalty, and they have neg lected to ensure there is a player on the penalty bench to exit upon the expiry of the penalty, they will continue to play short - handed but are not permitted to ice the puck. icing will be called. they may substitute for this penalized player at the next s toppage of play. see rule 20.3 –major penalties. rule 82–line changes 82.1line change -following the stoppage of play, the visiting team shall promptly place a line -up on the ice ready for play and no substitution shall be made from that time until play has been resumed. the home team may then make any desired substitution, except in case s following an icing, which does not result in the delay of the game. “placing a line -up on the ice” shall mean that both teams shall place the full complement of players (and not exceed) to which they are entitled within the line change time frame. if the re is any undue delay by either team in changing players, the referee shall order the offending team or teams to take their positions immediately and not permit any further player changes. when a substitution has been made under the above rule, no addition al substitution may be made until play commences.section 10 – game flow national hockey league official rules 20 21-2022 125 once the line change procedure has been completed ( 82.2), no additional player substitutions shall be permitted until the face- off has been completed legally and play has resumed, except when a penalty or penalties are imposed that affect the on-ice strength of either or both teams. this may include penalties imposed following the completion of the line change and prior to the face-off, or due to a penalty assessed for a face- off violation. a team that is in violation of rule 63.8 – delaying the game or rule 81 – icing shall not be permitted to make any player substitutions prior to the ensuing face-off. however, a team shall be permitted to make a player substitution to replace a goalkeeper who had been substituted for an extra attacker, to replace an injured p layer, or when a penalty has been assessed which affects the on-ice strength of either team. the determination of players on ice will be made when the puck leaves the offending player’s stick. goalkeepers’ substitution during a game will be conducted withi n the same time frame as a regular line change. no extra time will be allotted to the goalkeeper coming off the bench, except in the case where an injury to a goalkeeper occurs. 82.2 procedure - following a stoppage of play, the referee will enforce the following line change procedure once he has determined that this procedure may begin: (i) the referee shall give the visiting team up to five (5) seconds to make its line change. (ii) the referee shall raise his hand to indicate no further changes by the visiting team and to commence the home team’s line change.

(v) any attempt by the either team to make a change after the referee’s signal, attempt to place too many men on the ice for the subsequent line change, or attempt to make additional personnel changes, shall not be permitted and the referee will send the players who have attempted to change back to their players’ bench. the referee will then issue a warning to the offending team (through the coach) indicating that any subsequent violations during the rest of the game (including overtime), shall result in a bench minor penalty for delaying the game. this penalty shall be announced as a “bench minor penalty for delay of game – improper line change.” (vi) the linesman conducting the face-off will blow his whistle (once the referee has lowered his hand for the line changes) to indicate that all players must be in position and on-side for the face-off within five (5) seconds. the face-off will then be conducted in accordance with rule 76 – face-offs. (vii) players who are slow (after the five-second warning whistle given by the linesman) getting to the face-off location or who are in an off-side position for the ensuing face-off will be warned once in the game by the referee. this warning will also be given to the offending team’s coach. in this situation, the offending team’s center is not ejected from the face-off. any subsequent violation shall result in a bench minor penalty for delay of game being assessed to the offending team.section 10 – game flow national hockey league official rules 20 21-2022 126 (viii) in the last two (2) minutes of regulation time and any time in the overtime period(s), points (vi) and (vii) above are not applicable. the linesman shall give the teams a reasonable amount of time to set up for the ensuing face- off after points (1) through (5) above have been enforced. 82.3 bench minor penalty - any attempt by the visiting team to make a change after the referee’s signal shall result in the assessment of a bench minor penalty for delay of game. players must proceed directly to the location of the face- off to participate in the ensuing face-off. any attempts to delay the game by stalling or otherwise unnecessary actions by either team shall result in the assessment of a bench minor penalty for delaying the game. this penalty shall be announced as a “bench minor penalty for delay of game – slow proceeding to face-off location (or, slow proceeding to players’ bench).” during the play, if a player wishes to retire from the ice and be replaced by a substitute, he must do so at the players’ bench and not through any other exit leading from the rink. this is not a legal player change and therefore when a violation occurs, a bench minor penalty shall be imposed. rule 83 – off-side 83.1 off-side - players of the attacking team must not precede the puck into the attacking zone. the position of the player’s skates and not that of his stick shall be the determining factor in all instances in deciding an off-side. a player is off-side when both skates are completely over the leading edge of the blue line involved in the play. a player is on-side when either of his skates are in contact with the blue line, or on his own side of the line, at the instant the puck completely crosses the leading edge of the blue line. on his own side of the line shall be defined by a “plane” of the blue line which shall extend from the leading edge of the blue line upwards. if a player’s skate has yet to break the “plane” prior to the puck completely crossing the leading edge, he is deemed to be on-side for the purpos e of the off-side rule. a player actually controlling the puck who shall cross the line ahead of the puck shall not be considered “off-side,” provided he had possession and control of the puck prior to his skates crossing the leading edge of the blue line. if a player legally carries , passes or plays the puck back into his own defending zone while a player of the opposing team is in such defending zone, the off-side shall be ignored and play permitted to continue. 83.2 deflections / rebounds – for the purposes of this section, it is stipulated that an attacking player has preceded the puck into the attacking zone. section 10 –game flow national hockey league official rules 20 21-2022 127when a defending player propels the puck out of his defending zone and the puck clearly rebounds off a defending player in the neutral zone back into the defending zone, all attacking pla yers are eligible to play the puck. however, any action by an attacking player that causes a deflection/rebound off a defending player in the neutral zone back into the defending zone (i.e. stick check, body check, physical contact), a delayed off -side sh all be signaled by the linesman. a puck that deflects back into the defending zone off an official who is in the neutral zone will be off -side (or delayed off -side, as appropriate). a puck which deflects off an attacking player outside the blue line into the attacking zone, regardless of who originally propelled it or where it was propelled from, shall be r uled off -side or delayed off -side, as appropriate. a puck which is propelled by the attacking team and deflects off any player shall be ruled off -side or delayed off -side, as appropriate. 83.3 delayed off -side–a situation where an attacking player (or players) has preceded the puck across the attacking blue line, but the defending team is in a position to bring the puck back out of its defending zone wi thout any delay or contact with an attacking player, or, the attacking players are in the process of clearing the attacking zone. if an off -side call is delayed, the linesman shall drop his arm to nullify the off -side violation and allow play to continue if: (i) all players of the offending team clear the zone at the same instant (skate contact with the blue line) permitting the attacking players to re-enter the attacking zone, or (ii) the defending team passes or carries the puck into the neutral zone. if, during the course of the delayed off -side, any member of the attacking team touches the puck, attempts to gain possession of a loose puck, forces the defending puck carrier further back into his own zone, or who is about to make physical contact with the defending puck carrier, the linesman shall stop play for the off -side violation. if, during a delayed off -side, an attacking player in the attacking zone elects to proceed to his players’ bench (which extends into the attacking zone) to be replaced by a t eammate, he shall be considered to have cleared the zone when both skates are off the ice and the linesman judg es him to have left the playing surface .if his replacement comes onto the ice in the attacking zone, while the delayed off -side is still in effect, he too must clear the attacking zone. once all attacking players have cleared the attacking zone and the linesman has lowered his arm for the delayed off -side, all attacking players may legally enter the attacking zone and pursue the puck . 83.4disallowed goal –if the puck is shot into the attacking zone creating a delayed off -side, the play shall be allowed to continue under the normal clearing -the-zone rules. should the puck, as a result of this shot, enter the defending team’s goal, either directly or off t he goalkeeper, a player , the boards, the glass, a piece of equipment orsection 10 –game flow national hockey league official rules 20 21-2022 126team. (viii) in the last two (2) minutes of regulation time and any time in the overtime period(s), points (vi) and (vii) above are not applicable . the linesman shall give the teams a reasonable amount of time to set up for the ensuing face -off after points (1) through (5) above have been enforced. 82.3 bench minor penalty -any attempt by the visiting team to make a change after the referee’s signal sha ll result in the assessment of a bench minor penalty for delay of game. players must proceed directly to the location of the face -off to participate in the ensuing face -off. any attempts to delay the game by stalling or otherwise unnecessary actions by eit her team shall result in the assessment of a bench minor penalty for delaying the game. this penalty shall be announced as a “bench minor penalty for delay of game –slow proceeding to face -off location (or, slow proceeding to players’ bench).” during the play, if a player wishes to retire from the ice and be replaced by a substitute, he must do so at the players’ bench and not through any other exit leading from the rink. this is not a legal player change and therefore when a violation occurs, a bench minor penalty shall be imposed. rule 83–off-side 83.1off-side -players of the attacking team must not precede the puck into the attacking zone. the position of the player’s skates and not that of his stick shall be the determining factor in all instances in deciding an off -side. a player is off -side when both skates are completely over the leading edge of the blue line involved in the play. a player is on -side when either of his skates are in contact with the blue line , or on his own side of the line, at the instant the puck completely crosses the leading edge of the blue line. on his own side of the lin e shall be defined by a “plane” of the blue line which shall extend from the leading edge of the blue l ine upwards. if a player’s skate has yet to break the “plane” prior to the puck completely crossing the leading edge, he is deemed to be on -side for the purpos e of the off -side rule. aplayer actually controlling the puck who shall cross the line ahead of the puck shall not be considered “off -side,” provided he had possession and control of the puck prior to his skates crossing the leading edge of the blue line. if a player legally carries , passes or plays the puck back into his own defending zone while a player of the opposing team is in such defending zone, the off -side shall be ignored and play permitted to continue. 83.2 deflections / rebounds –for the purposes of this section, it is stipulated tha t an attacking player has preceded the puck into the attacking zone.section 10 – game flow national hockey league official rules 20 21-2022 127 when a defending player propels the puck out of his defending zone and the puck clearly rebounds off a defending player in the neutral zone back into the defending zone, all attacking players are eligible to play the puck. however, any action by an attacking player that causes a deflection/rebound off a defending player in the neutral zone back into the defending zone (i.e. stick check, body check, physical contact), a delayed off -side sh all be signaled by the linesman. a puck that deflects back into the defending zone off an official who is in the neutral zone will be off-side (or delayed off-side, as appropriate). a puck which deflects off an attacking player outside the blue line into the attacking zone, regardless of who originally propelled it or where it was propelled from, shall be ruled off-side or delayed off-side, as appropriate. a puck which is propelled by the attacking team and deflects off any player shall be ruled off-side or delayed off- side, as appropriate. 83.3 delayed off-side – a situation where an attacking player (or players) has preceded the puck across the attacking blue line, but the defending team is in a position to bring the puck back out of its defending zone without any delay or contact with an attacking player, or, the attacking players are in the process of clearing the attacking zone. if an off-side call is delayed, the linesman shall drop his arm to nullify the off-side violation and allow play to continue if: (i) all players of the offending team clear the zone at the same instant (skate contact with the blue line) permitting the attacking players to re-enter the attacking zone, or (ii) the defending team passes or carries the puck into the neutral zone. if, during the course of the delayed off-side, any member of the attacking team touches the puck, attempts to gain possession of a loose puck, forces the defending puck carrier further back into his own zone, or who is about to make physical contact with the defending puck carrier, the linesman shall stop play for the off-side violation. if, during a delayed off-side, an attacking player in the attacking zone elects to proceed to his players’ bench (which extends into the attacking zone) to be replaced by a teammate, he shall be considered to have cleared the zone when both skates are off the ice and the linesman judg es him to have left the playing surface. if his replacement comes onto the ice in the attacking zone, while the delayed off-side is still in effect, he too must clear the attacking zone. once all attacking players have cleared the attacking zone and the linesman has lowered his arm for the delayed off-side, all attacking players may legally enter the attacking zone and pursue the puck . 83.4 disallowed goal – if the puck is shot into the attacking zone creating a delayed off -side, the play shall be allowed to continue under the normal clearing- the-zone rules. should the puck, as a result of this shot, enter the defending team’s goal, either directly or off t he goalkeeper, a player, the boards, the glass, a piece of equipment or section 10 – game flow national hockey league official rules 20 21-2022 128 an official on the ice, the goal shall be disallowed as the original shot was off-side. the fact that the attacking team may have cleared the zone prior to the puck entering the goal has no bearing on this ruling. the face- off will be conducted at the face -off spot in the zone closest to the point of origin of the shot that gives the offending team the least amount of territorial advantage. the only way an attacking team can score a goal on a delayed off- side situation is if the defending team shoots or puts the puck into their own net without action or contact by the offending team. other than in situations involving a delayed off-side and the puck entering the goal or a successful coach’s challenge (see rule 38), no goal can be disallowed after the fact for an off- side violation, except for the human factor involved in blowing the whistle. 83.5 coach’s challenge – refer to rule 38. 83.6 face-off location - for violation of this rule, the play is stopped and the puck shall be faced-off in the neutral zone at the face- off spot nearest the attacking zone of the offending team when the violation occurs as a result of the attacking team carrying the puck over the attacking blue line, or from the face-off spot in the zone closest to the point of origin of the shot or pass (even if deflected off an attacking or defending player or an official). for every delayed off-side situation, including an intentional off- side, the linesman will raise his non-whistle arm. he will allow play to continue and, if a stoppage of play occurs, there will be four possible face- off locations: (i) if carried over the blue line – face-off outside the blue line.
