2022 official playing rules of the national football league roger goodell, commissioner 2022 rules changes rule-section-article 6-1-3 makes permanent the free kick formation change implemented during the 2021 season. 16-1-4 modified overtime in postseason games to require that each team has the opportunity to possess the ball. preface this edition of the official playing rules of the national football league contains all current rules governing the playing of professional football that are in effect for the 2022 nfl season. member clubs of the league may amend the rules from time to time, pursuant to the applicable voting procedures of the nfl constitution and bylaws. any intra-league dispute or call for interpretation in connection with these rules will be decided by the commissioner of the league, whose ruling will be final. because inter-conference games are played throughout the preseason, regular season, and postseason in the nfl, all rules contained in this book apply uniformly to both the american and national football conferences. where the word “illegal” appears in this rule book, it is an institutional term of art pertaining strictly to actions that violate nfl playing rules. it is not meant to connote illegality under any public law or the rules or regulations of any other organization. the word “flagrant,” when used here to describe an action by a player, is meant to indicate that the degree of a violation of the rules—usually a personal foul or unnecessary roughness—is extremely objectionable, conspicuous, unnecessary, avoidable, or gratuitous. “flagrant” in these rules does not necessarily imply malice on the part of the fouling player or an intention to injure an opponent. copyright © 2022 by the national football league. all rights

lines and sidelines. there will be an additional broken yellow line nine feet farther outside this border along each sideline in the non-bench areas, and such broken line will be continued at an angle from each 25-yard line and pass behind the bench area (all benches a minimum of 30 feet back from the sidelines) at a distance of six feet. in each end zone, this broken yellow line is six feet from the solid white border. these yellow broken lines are to be eight inches wide and two feet long with a space of one foot between them.in addition, within each bench area, a solid yellow line six feet behind the solid border will delineate a special area for coaches, behind which all players, except one player who is charting the game, must remain. furthermore, a broken white line four inches wide and four feet long with a space of two-foot intervals will be marked three feet inside the nine-foot restriction line on the sideline, extending to meet the existing yellow broken line six feet behind both end zones and at each television box outside the bench area.2. all lines are to be four inches wide, with the exception of the goal line and yellow lines, which are to be eight inches wide. tolerance of line widths is plus one-fourth inch.3. all line work is to be laid out to dimensions shown on the plan with a tolerance of plus one-fourth inch. all lines are straight.4. all boundary lines, goal lines, and marked yard lines are to be continuous lines.5. the four intersections of goal lines and sidelines must be marked at inside corners of the end zone and the goal line by pylons. pylons must be placed at inside edges of white lines and should not touch the surface of the actual playing field itself.6. all lines are to be marked with a material that is not injurious to eyes or skin.7. no benches or rigid fixtures should be nearer than 1o yards from the sidelines. if space permits, they may be further back.8. player benches can be situated anywhere between respective 30-yard lines. where possible, a continuation of the dotted yellow line is to extend from the25-yard lines to a point six feet behind the player benches thereby enclosing this area.9. a white arrow is to be placed on the ground adjacent to the top portion of each number (with the exception of the 50) with the point formed by the two longer sides pointing toward the goal line. the two longer sides measure 36 inches each, while the side measures 18 inches. the 18-inch crossfield side is to start 15 inches below the top, and 6 inches from the goalward edge of each outer number (except the 50).10. the location of the inbounds lines is 70’9” for professional football, 60’0” for college football. on fields used primarily by the nfl, the professional inbounds lines should be 4 inches wide by 2 feet long. alternate college lines, if they are to be included, should be 4 inches wide by 1 foot long.11. care must be exercised in any end zone marking, decoration, or c l u b identification at the 50-yard line, that said marks or decorations do not in any way cause confusion as to delineation of goal lines, sidelines, and end lines. such markings or decorations must be approved by the commissioner.inbound yard markers dimensions for numerals on the playing field dimensions for the directional arrows field markings 6.7.22chain crew and officials onlynfl bench area showing

dimensions article 1. playing lines. the game shall be played upon a rectangular field, 360 feet in length and 160 feet in width. the lines at each end of the field are termed end lines. those on each side are termed sidelines. goal lines shall be established in the field 10 yards from and parallel to each end line. the area bounded by goal lines and sidelines is known as the field of play. the surface of the entire field of play must be a league-approved shade of green. the areas bounded by goal lines, end lines, and sidelines are known as the end zones. the areas bounded by goal lines and lines parallel to, and 70 feet 9 inches inbounds, from each sideline, are known as the side zones. the lines parallel to sidelines are termed inbound lines. the end lines and the sidelines are also termed boundary lines. article 2. field. the field includes the field of play and the end zones. the field will be rimmed by a solid white border a minimum of 6 feet wide along the end lines and sidelines. an additional broken limit line 6 feet further outside this border is to encompass the field in the non-bench areas, and such broken line will be continued at an angle from each 25-yard line and pass behind the bench areas (all benches a minimum 30 feet back from the sidelines). in addition, within each bench area, a yellow line 6 feet behind the solid white border will delineate a special area for coaches, behind which all players, except one player charting the game, must remain. if a club’s solid white border is a minimum of 12 feet wide, there is no requirement that the broken restraining line also be added in the non-bench areas. however, the appropriate yellow line described above must be clearly marked within the bench areas. in special circumstances (for example, an artificial surface in a multi-purpose stadium) and subject to prior approval from the league office, a club may omit the 6-foot solid white border during the preseason or later period while football overlaps with another sport, and substitute a single 4-inch white line at what normally would be the outer limit of the solid border (6 feet from the sidelines). section 2 markings article 1. line markings. at intervals of 5 yards, yard lines (3-12-9) parallel to the goal lines shall be marked in the field of play. these lines are to stop 8 inches short of the 6-foot solid border. the 4-inch wide yard lines are to be extended 4 inches beyond the white 6-foot border along the sidelines. each of these lines shall be intersected at right angles by short lines 70 feet, 9 inches long (23 yards, 1 foot, 9 inches) in from each side to indicate inbound lines. article 2. inbound lines. in line with the inbound lines there shall be marks at 1-yard intervals between each distance of 5 yards for the full length of the field. these lines are to begin 8 inches from the 6-foot solid border and are to measure 2 feet in length. bottoms of numbers indicating yard lines in multiples of 10 must be placed beginning 12 yards in from each sideline. these are to be 2 yards in length. two yards from the middle of each goal line and parallel to it, there shall be marked in the field of play, lines 1 yard in length. all boundary lines, goal lines, and marked lines are to be continuous lines. these, and any other specified markings, must be in white, and there shall be no exceptions without the authorization of the commissioner. field numerals must also be white. care must be exercised in any end-zone marking or decoration or club identification at the 50-yard line that said marking or decorations do not in any way cause confusion as to delineation of goal lines, sidelines, and end lines. such markings or decorations must be approved by the commissioner. the four intersections of goal lines and sidelines must be marked, at inside corners, by weighted pylons. in addition, two such pylons shall be placed on each end line (four in all). article 3. goal line. all measurements are to be made from the inside edges of the line marking the boundary lines. each goal line marking is to be in its end zone so that the edge of the line toward the field of play (actual goal line) is 30 feet from the inside edge of the end line. each goal line is to be eight inches wide. all lines are to be marked with a material that is not injurious to eyes or skin. it is desirable that the yard line markers be flexible in order to prevent injury. no benches or rigid fixtures should be nearer than 10 yards from sidelines. article 4. ground rules. in league parks where ground rules are necessary, because of fixed conditions that cannot be changed, they will be made by the commissioner. section 3 goal article 1. crossbar. in the plane of each end line, there shall be a centrally placed horizontal crossbar 18 feet, 6 inches in length, the top face of which is 10 feet above the ground. the goal is the vertical plane extending indefinitely above the crossbar and between the lines indicated by the outer edges of the goal posts. article 2. goal posts. all goal posts will be the single-standard type, offset from the end line and bright gold in color. the uprights will extend 35 feet above the crossbar and will be no less than 3 inches and no more than 4 inches in diameter. an orange-colored ribbon 4 inches by 42 inches is to be attached to the top of each post. note: goal posts must be padded in a manner prescribed by the league. section 4 players’ benches at the option of the home team, both the players’ benches may be located on the same side of the field. in such a case, the end of each bench shall start at the 45-yard line and continue towards the adjacent goal line. 1rule 1 note: when both benches are so located, the chain crew and linespersons are to operate during the entire game on the opposite side to the benches. section 5 chain crew and ball boys/girls members of the chain crew and the ball boys/girls must be uniformly identifiable as specified by the commissioner. white shirts are to be worn by members of the chain crew. section 6 sideline markers the home club must provide and use the standard set of sideline markers that have been approved by the commissioner. 2rule 2 the ball section 1 dimensions the ball must be a “wilson,” hand selected, bearing the signature of the commissioner of the league, roger goodell. the ball shall be made up of an inflated (12½ to 13½ pounds) urethane bladder enclosed in a pebble grained, leather case (natural tan color) without corrugations of any kind. it shall have the form of a prolate spheroid and the size and weight shall be: long axis, 11 to 11¼ inches; long circumference, 28 to 28½ inches; short circumference, 21 to 21¼ inches; weight, 14 to 15 ounces. the referee shall be the sole judge as to whether all balls offered for play comply with these specifications. a pump is to be furnished by the home club, and the balls shall remain under the supervision of the referee until they are delivered to the ball attendant just prior to the start of the game. section 2 supply each team will make 12 primary and 12 backup balls available for testing by the referee no later than two hours and 30 minutes prior to the starting time of the game to meet league requirements. for all games, six new footballs, sealed in a special box and shipped by the manufacturer to the referee, will be opened in the officials’ locker room two hours and 15 minutes prior to the starting time of the game. these balls are to be specially marked by the referee and used exclusively for the kicking game. in the event a home team ball does not conform to specifications, or its supply is exhausted, the referee shall secure a proper ball from the visitors and, failing that, use the best available ball. any such circumstances must be reported to the commissioner. in case of rain or a wet, muddy, or slippery field, a playable ball shall be used at the request of the offensive team’s center. the game clock shall not stop for such action (unless undue delay occurs). note: it is the responsibility of the home team to furnish playable balls at all times by attendants from either side of the playing field. 3rule 3 definitions section 1 approved ruling (a.r.) an approved ruling (a.r.) is a written decision on a given statement of facts and serves to illustrate the intent and application of a rule. supplemental notes are used to amplify a rule. a note is more specific and applies to a particular situation. it is also used to indicate pertinent references to other rules. an official ruling (o.r.) is a ruling made in the interim between the annual rules meetings and is official only during the current season. technical terms are such terms that have a fixed and defined meaning throughout the playing rules. because of their alphabetical arrangement in rule 3, certain ones are used prior to being defined. in such cases, they appear in bold type only the first time they are used. section 2 the ball and possession of the ball article 1. dead ball. a dead ball is one that is not in play. the time period during which the ball is dead is between downs. this includes the interval during all timeouts, including intermission, and from the time the ball becomes dead until it is legally put in play. article 2. ball ready for play. a dead ball is ready for play while the 40-second play clock is running when the ball is placed down by an official at the spot where the ball will next be put in play, or when the referee signals for the 25-second play clock to start. article 3. live ball. a live ball is a ball that is in play. a dead ball becomes a live ball when it is: (a) legally kicked on a free kick down (6-1-1; 6-1-3); (b) legally snapped on a scrimmage down (7-1-1; 7-3-6); or (c) legally kicked on a fair catch kick down. it continues in play until the down ends (3-9-1). article 4. loose ball. a loose ball is a live ball that is not in player possession, i.e., any ball that has been kicked, passed, or fumbled. a loose ball is considered to be in possession of the team (offense) whose player kicked, passed, or fumbled it. it is a loose ball until a player secures possession or until the ball becomes dead. if it has not yet struck the ground, a loose ball is in flight. article 5. fumble. a fumble is any act, other than passing, successful handing, or legally kicking the ball, which results in a loss of player possession. it is not a fumble if the player immediately regains control of the ball. the use of the term fumble always means that the ball was in possession of a player when the act occurred (8-7-3). note: an intentional fumble that causes the ball to go forward is a forward pass and may be illegal (8-1-1-pen. a–c). article 6. muff. a muff is the touching of a loose ball by a player in an unsuccessful attempt to obtain possession of it. note: any ball intentionally muffed forward is a bat and may be a foul (3-3; 12-5-1; 3-15). touching the ball refers to any contact with the ball. there is no distinction between a player touching the ball with his hands, or with any other part of his body, including his hair, except as specifically provided for (9-2-2). note: the result of the touching is sometimes influenced by the intent or the location. (a) see 6-1-4 and 6-2-4 for touching a free kick. (b) see 6-2-3 for touching a free kick before it goes out of bounds between the goal lines. (c) see 8-1-8 for ineligible offensive player touching a forward pass on, behind, or beyond the line. (d) see 9-2-1, 9-3-1 for touching a scrimmage kick on or behind the line, and also 9-2-4 for being pushed into a kick by an opponent. (e) see 11-4-2 for touching a kick during an attempted field goal. (f) simultaneous touching by two opponents in an attempt to establish possession of a ball that has been kicked is treated as a first touch by the kicking team. article 7. player possession. a player is in possession when he is inbounds and has control of the ball with his hands or arms. to gain possession of a loose ball that has been caught, intercepted, or recovered, a player (a) must have complete control of the ball with his hands or arms and (b) have both feet or any other part of his body, other than his hands, completely on the ground inbounds, and, after (a) and (b) have been fulfilled, perform any act common to the game (e.g., tuck the ball away, extend it forward, take an additional step, turn upfield, or avoid or ward off an opponent). it is not necessary that he commit such an act, provided that he maintains control of the ball long enough to do so. this rule applies in the field of play, at the sideline, and in the end zone. notes: (1) movement of the ball does not automatically result in loss of control. (2) if a player who has completed the first two, but not the third requirement for possession, contacts the ground and loses control of the ball, there is no possession if the ball hits the ground before he regains control, or if he regains control out of bounds. if a player would have caught, intercepted, or recovered a ball inbounds, but is carried out of bounds, player possession will be granted (8-1-3-note 5). the terms catch, intercept, recover, advance, and fumble denote player possession (as distinguished from touching or muffing). 4rule 3 a catch is made when a player inbounds secures possession of a pass, kick, or fumble that is in flight. an interception is made when an opponent who is inbounds catches a forward or backward pass or a fumble that has not touched the ground. notes: (1) it is a catch, or an interception, if, in the process of attempting to possess the ball, a player secures control of the ball prior to it touching the ground, and that control is maintained during and after the ball has touched the ground. (2) in the field of play, if a catch or interception has been completed, and the ball comes loose before the player is down by contact, it is a fumble, and the ball remains alive. it is also a fumble if the action occurs in the end zone of the player who caught the loose ball. if the action occurs in the opponent’s end zone, it is a touchdown or a touchback. (3) if there is any question by the covering official(s) as to whether a forward pass is complete, intercepted, or incomplete, it always will be ruled incomplete. a recovery is made when a player inbounds secures possession of a loose ball after it has touched the ground. if a loose ball is controlled simultaneously by two opponents, and both players retain it, it is simultaneous possession, and the ball belongs to the team last in possession, or to the receiving team when there has been a free kick, scrimmage kick, or fair catch kick. it is not simultaneous possession if a player gains control first and an opponent subsequently gains joint control. section 3 bat a bat is the intentional striking of the ball with any part of the hand or arm. see 12-5-1. section 4 blocking blocking is the act of obstructing or impeding an opponent by contacting him with a part of the blocker’s body. a block in the back is a block that is delivered from behind an opponent above his waist. it is not a block in the back: (a) if a player is making a personal attempt to recover a loose ball; (b) if the opponent turns away from the blocker when contact is imminent; (c) if both of the blocker’s hands are on the opponent’s side. (if either hand is on the back, it is a foul.) a block below the waist is when the initial contact with any part of the blocker’s body is below the waist of an opponent, other than the runner, who has one or both feet on the ground. a blocker who makes contact above the waist and then slides below the waist has not blocked below the waist. if an opponent uses his hands to ward off a block creating contact below the waist, it is not a block below the waist. section 5 chucking chucking is intentionally contacting an eligible receiver who is in front of a defender. (see 12-1-5-d-exc. 1). section 6 clipping clipping is blocking an opponent from behind below the waist, provided the opponent is not a runner. it is not clipping if an opponent turns his back as the block is delivered or about to be delivered. notes: (1) it is clipping (including in close-line play) if an offensive player’s block (legal or illegal) is followed by the blocker rolling up on the side or back of the legs of the defender. (2) see 12-2-1 for additional interpretations or restrictions concerning clipping in close-line play. section 7 close-line play close-line play is contact that occurs in an area extending between the outside edges of the normal tackle positions and three yards on either side of the line of scrimmage. section 8 disqualified player a disqualified player is one who is prohibited from further participation in the game. he must return to his dressing room within a reasonable period of time and is not permitted to reappear in his team uniform or return to any area other than to which spectators have access. section 9 down article 1. down. a down is a period of action that starts when the ball is put in play (3-2-3) and ends when the ball is declared dead (7-2-1). a down that starts with a snap is a scrimmage down (3-30). a down that starts with a free kick is a free kick down (6-1-1). a down that starts with a fair catch kick is a fair catch kick down (10-2-4-a; 11-4-3). article 2. series of downs. a series of downs is the four consecutive charged scrimmage downs allotted to the offensive team during which it must advance the ball to a yard line called “the line to gain” in order to retain possession. article 3. line to gain. the line to gain is the spot 10 yards in advance of the spot of the snap that starts a series, except when a goal line is less than 10 yards from this spot. in that case, the line to gain is the goal line. article 4. charged down. a charged down is a scrimmage down that is not nullified by a penalty, or during which there is not a change of possession. it counts as a down in a series of downs. 5rule 3 article 5. first down. the initial down in each series is the first down. if it is a charged down, subsequent charged downs are numbered consecutively (i.e., second down, third down, or fourth down) until a new series is declared for either team (7-3). section 10 fair catch a fair catch is an unhindered catch of a scrimmage kick (provided that it has crossed the line of scrimmage), or of a free kick, that is in flight by a player of the receiving team who has legally signaled his intention of attempting such a catch (10-2-1). note: for fair-catch kick, see 11-4-3. section 11 field goal a field goal is made by kicking the ball from the field of play through the plane of the opponents’ goal, which is an area either between the goal posts and above the cross bar, or, if above the goal posts, between the outside edges of the goal posts. a field goal is made by a drop kick or a place kick from (a) on or behind the line on a play from scrimmage or (b) during a fair catch kick. see 11-4-3; 3-18-1-item 1-2; and 10-2-4-a. section 12 the field article 1. boundary lines. the boundary lines are the end lines and the sidelines and enclose the field upon which the game is played. article 2. end lines. the end lines are the lines at each end of the field and are perpendicular to the sidelines. the end line is 10 yards from the goal line and at the back of the end zone. article 3. end zone. the end zone is the rectangle formed by the goal line, the end line, and the sidelines. the goal line and the pylons are in the end zone. article 4. field of play. the field of play is the rectangle formed by the goal lines and the sidelines. it does not include the end zone. article 5. goal. the goal is the area above the crossbar between the uprights, or, if above the uprights, the area between the outside edges of the uprights. a team’s own goal is the one it is defending. the adjacent goal line is known as its goal line. article 6. goal lines. the goal lines are the lines between the sidelines that separate the end zone from the field of play. the goal lines are vertical planes that are parallel to and 10 yards from the end lines. article 7. inbounds lines. the inbounds lines are hash marks on the field of play that are 70 feet nine inches from and parallel to each sideline. article 8. sidelines. the sidelines are the lines on each side of the field and are perpendicular to the end lines. the sidelines separate the field of play from the area that is out of bounds. article 9. yard line. a yard line is any line and its vertical plane parallel to the end line. the yard lines (marked or unmarked) in the field of play are named by number in yards from a team’s goal line to the center of the field. note: the yard line 19 yards from team a’s goal line is called a’s 19-yard line. the yard line 51 yards from a’s goal line is called b’s 49-yard line. for brevity, these are referred to as a’s 19 and b’s 49 or a19 and b49. section 13 forward progress article 1. forward progress. the forward progress of a runner or airborne receiver is the point at which his advance toward his opponent’s goal ends and is the spot at which the ball is declared dead by rule, irrespective of the runner or receiver being pushed or carried backward by an opponent. article 2. forward, beyond, or in advance. forward, beyond, or in advance of are terms that designate a point nearer the goal line of the defense. backward or behind designate a point nearer the goal line of the offense. a pass parallel to a yard line, or an offensive player moving parallel to it at the snap, is considered backward. section 14 fouls and spots of enforcement, violation article 1. types of fouls. a foul is any infraction of a playing rule for which a penalty is prescribed. (a) a live ball foul is a foul that occurs during the period after the snap until the ball is dead. (b) a dead ball foul is a foul that occurs in the continuing action after a down ends, or a taunting foul that occurs at any time. (c) a foul between downs is a foul that occurs after the end of the down and after any continuing action resulting from the down, but prior to the next snap or free kick. (d) a multiple foul is one of two or more fouls by the same team during the same down (14-1-3), including dead ball fouls. (e) a double foul is a foul by either team during the same down during which both teams commit at least one foul, including dead ball fouls. article 2. basic spot. the basic spot is a reference point for specific types of plays that is used to determine the spot of enforcement. article 3. spots of enforcement. the spot of enforcement is the spot at which a penalty is enforced. six such spots are commonly used: (a) the previous spot: the spot at which the ball was last put in play. (b) the spot of the foul: the spot at which a foul was committed or, by rule, is considered to have been committed. (c) the spot of a backward pass or a fumble: the spot at which the backward pass or fumble occurred during the down in which there was a foul. 6rule 3 (d) the dead ball spot: the spot at which the ball became dead. (e) the succeeding spot: the spot at which the ball will next be put in play (i.e., the spot of the ball after enforcement for a foul, or, if there has been no foul, the spot at which the ball became dead). (f) the spot of a change of possession: the spot at which possession is gained by or awarded to the opponent. article 4. violation. a violation is an infraction of a playing rule for which a penalty is not prescribed. a violation does not offset a foul. section 15 handing the ball handing the ball is transferring player possession from one teammate to another without passing or kicking it. (a) except where permitted by rule, handing the ball forward to a teammate is illegal. (b) loss of player possession by unsuccessful execution of attempted handing is a fumble charged to the player that last had possession. a muffed handoff (legal or illegal) is a fumble, unless either player immediately regains control of the ball, and the ball remains alive. (c) a forward handoff occurs when the ball is handed (regardless of the direction of the movement of the ball) to a player who is in advance of a teammate from whose hands he takes or receives it. section 16 huddle a huddle is the action of two or more players in the field of play or in the end zone who, instead of assuming their normal position for the snap, free kick, or fair catch kick form a group for receiving instructions for the next play or for any other reason. section 17 impetus impetus is the action of a player who carries the ball or provides the force (i.e., a pass, kick, snap, or fumble) that causes a ball in the field of play to touch or cross a goal line. if a loose ball touches or crosses a goal line, the impetus is attributed to the team whose player passed, kicked, snapped, or fumbled the ball, unless an opponent: (a) muffs a ball that is at rest, or nearly at rest; (b) bats a ball that has been kicked or fumbled; (c) bats a backward pass after it has struck the ground; or (d) illegally kicks any ball (see 12-5-2). note: (1) the impetus is always attributed to the offense, unless the defense creates a new force that sends the ball behind its own goal line by muffing a ball which is at rest or nearly at rest, or by batting a loose ball on the ground or kicking any loose ball. (2) if a passive player is pushed or blocked into any kicked or fumbled ball or into a backward pass after it has struck the ground, causing the loose ball to touch a goal line or anything on or behind a goal line, the impetus is attributed to the pusher or blocker, provided that the pushed (blocked) player was not making an attempt to block an opponent. section 18 kicks article 1. kick. a kick is intentionally striking the ball with the knee, lower leg, or foot. a kick ends when a player of either team possesses the ball, or when the ball is dead. item 1. drop kick. a drop kick is a kick by a player who drops the ball and kicks it as, or immediately after, it touches the ground. item 2. placekick. a placekick is a kick made by a player while the ball is in a fixed position on the

or (2) the injury occurs during a down in which there is a change of possession, a touchdown, a safety, a successful field goal, or an attempted try. (b) if a team has used its three charged team timeouts, an excess team timeout shall be called by the referee, unless: (1) the injury is the result of a foul by an opponent; or (2) the injury occurs during a down in which there is a change of possession, a touchdown, a safety, a successful field goal, or an attempted try. (c) the player must leave the game for the completion of one down, unless: (1) the injury is the result of a foul by an opponent; or (2) either team calls or is charged a team timeout other than an excess timeout. penalty: for the second and each subsequent excess team timeout after the two-minute warning: loss of five yards from the succeeding spot for delay of the game. notes: (1) no yardage penalty will be assessed for the first excess team timeout, but a 10-second runoff of the game clock may be applicable pursuant to note 3 below. at the conclusion of an excess timeout taken while time is in, the game clock shall start with the ready-for-play signal. for any excess timeout charged to the defense, the play clock is reset to 40 seconds. (2) if the referee has already called an excess team timeout in that half for a team, any subsequent excess timeout for that team will result in a five-yard penalty, and a 10-second runoff of the game clock may be applicable pursuant to note 3 below. (such penalty shall be considered a foul between downs and will not offset a foul or be part of a multiple foul). (3) if an excess team timeout is charged against a team in possession of the ball, and the timeout causes the clock to stop or delays the clock from starting on the ready-for-play signal, the ball shall not be put in play until the time on the game clock has been reduced by 10 seconds, if the defense so chooses. supplemental notes: (1) either half can end as the result of the 10-second runoff referenced above. (2) if an injury timeout is called for both teams during or after a down, charged team timeouts and/or excess team timeouts are charged as appropriate, but no yardage or 10-second runoff penalties shall be enforced. (3) if a foul by either team occurs during a down in which there is also an injury, such foul does not affect the charging of an excess timeout, but it does prevent a 10-second runoff that may result from the excess timeout, because the foul stopped the clock. (4) the competition committee deprecates feigning injuries, with subsequent withdrawal, to obtain a timeout without penalty. coaches are urged to cooperate in discouraging this practice. (5) there can never be a 10-second runoff against the defensive team. (6) see rule 16 (sudden-death procedures) for application to overtime games. article 5. referee’s timeout. provided that calling timeout is not in conflict with another rule, the referee may suspend play and stop the clock (referee’s timeout) at any time without penalty to either team when playing time is being consumed because of an unintentional delay. such situations include, but are not limited to: (a) when there is the possibility of a measurement for a first down, or if the referee is consulting with a captain about one; (b) when there is an undue pileup on the runner, or while determining possession after a fumble while time is in; (c) when there is an undue delay by officials in spotting the ball for the next snap;

or (g) while repairing or replacing game equipment, except player equipment. after a referee’s timeout, the game clock will start pursuant to rule 4, section 3, as if the referee’s timeout had not occurred. 14rule 4 the time remaining on the play clock shall be the same as when it stopped. see rule 4, section 6, article 3. section 6 delay of game article 1. 40-second play clock. it is a delay of the game if the ball is not put in play by a snap within 40 seconds after the start of the play clock. the play clock operator shall time the interval between plays upon signals from game officials. the 40-second interval starts when a play ends, unless article 2 below applies. article 2. 25-second play clock. in the event of certain administrative stoppages or other delays, a team will have 25 seconds, beginning with the referee’s whistle, to put the ball in play next by a snap or a kick. such stoppages include, but are not limited to: (a) a change of possession; (b) a charged team timeout; (c) the two-minute warning; (d) the expiration of a period; (e) a penalty enforcement; (f) a try; (g) a free kick; or (h) replay administration pursuant to rule 15, section 3, article 9, if the play clock is under 25 seconds. a 25-second interval will be used in these situations, even if the 40-second clock is already counting down. note: following a try or successful field-goal attempt, unless there is a commercial break, the teams will have 40 seconds to align prior to the ball being made ready for play. when the 40 seconds have elapsed, the 25-second play clock will begin. article 3. interruption of play clock. if the play clock is stopped prior to the snap for any reason, after the stoppage has concluded, the time remaining on the play clock shall be the same as when it stopped, unless: (a) the stoppage has been for a charged team timeout, the two-minute warning, the expiration of a period, a penalty enforcement, or an instant replay challenge prior to the two-minute warning, in which case the play clock shall be reset to 25 seconds; (b) the stoppage has been for an instant replay review after the two-minute warning that results in a reversal, in which case the play clock shall be reset to 25 seconds; (c) the stoppage has been for an excess timeout while time is in that is charged to the defense, in which case the play clock shall be reset to 40 seconds; or (d) fewer than 10 seconds remain on the play clock, in which case it shall be reset to 10 seconds, or the exact time on the play clock at the discretion of the referee. article 4. ball remains dead. if the ball is not put in play within the applicable period, the back judge shall blow his whistle for the foul, and the ball remains dead. see 14-4-1-item 1. article 5. other delay of game fouls. other examples of action or inaction that are to be construed as delay of the game include, but are not limited to: (a) a player unnecessarily remains on a dead ball or on a runner who has been downed; (b) the snapper repeatedly snaps the ball after the neutral zone is established and before all the officials have had a reasonable time to assume their positions (see 7-6-3-c); (c) undue delay by either team in assembling after a timeout; (d) a defensive player aligned in a stationary position within one yard of the line of scrimmage makes quick and abrupt actions that are not a part of normal defensive player movement and are an obvious attempt to cause an offensive player(s) to foul (false start). the officials shall blow their whistles immediately. if the defender is walking or running toward the line of scrimmage in an effort to time the snap, but stops abruptly because the snap is not made, it is not a foul for delay of game; (e) spiking or throwing the ball in the field of play after a down has ended, except after a score; (f) intentional contact with the football to delay the snap or the officials’ ability to make the ball ready for play; or (g) when a timeout is erroneously granted. see 4-5-1-note for enforcement. penalty: for delay of the game: loss of five yards: (a) from the succeeding spot if it occurs between downs. the ball remains dead; or (b) from the previous spot if the ball was in play. section 7 actions to conserve time article 1. illegal acts. a team is not permitted to conserve time after the two-minute warning of either half by committing any of these acts: (a) a foul by either team that prevents the snap (i.e., false start, encroachment, etc.); (b) intentional grounding; (c) an illegal forward pass; (d) throwing a backward pass out of bounds; (e) spiking or throwing the ball in the field of play after a down has ended, except after a touchdown; or (f) any intentional foul that causes the clock to stop. penalty: for illegally conserving time: loss of five yards unless a larger distance penalty is applicable. when actions referred to above are committed by the offensive team while time is in, officials will run off 10 seconds from the game clock before permitting the ball to be put in play on the ready-for-play signal. the game clock will start on the ready-for-play signal unless another rule prescribes otherwise. if the offensive team has timeouts remaining, it will have the option of using a timeout in lieu of a 10-second runoff, in which case the game clock will start on the snap after the timeout. the defense always 15rule 4 has the option to decline the 10-second runoff and have the yardage penalty enforced, but if the yardage penalty is declined, the 10-second runoff is also declined. if the action is by the defense, the play clock will be reset to 40 seconds, and the game clock will start on the ready signal, unless the offense chooses to have the clock start on the snap. if the defense has timeouts remaining, it will have the option of using a timeout in lieu of the game clock being started. notes: (1) two successive delay penalties during the same down when time is in, is unsportsmanlike conduct (12-3-1-n). after enforcement of the 15-yard penalty, the game clock shall start on the snap. (2) certain acts of delay may involve stopping the game clock immediately. repeated violations of the substitution rule to conserve time are unsportsmanlike conduct (12-3-1-m and 5-2). article 2. substitution violation after two-minute warning. after the two-minute warning of either half, if there is a violation of the substitution rule while the ball is dead and time is in, in addition to the applicable yardage penalty for illegal substitution, there will be a 10-second runoff pursuant to article 1 above, unless it is obvious that the offensive team is not attempting to conserve time. penalty: for illegal substitution: loss of five yards (unless a larger distance penalty is applicable) and a 10-second runoff. article 3. defensive fouls during last 40 seconds. in the last 40 seconds of either half, if there is a defensive foul prior to the snap while time is in, the half will end, unless the defense has timeouts remaining, or the offense chooses to have the game clock start on the snap. article 4. replay review after two-minute warning of either half. if a replay review after the two-minute warning of either half results in the on-field ruling being reversed and the correct ruling would not have stopped the game clock, then the officials will run 10 seconds off the game clock before permitting the ball to be put in play on the ready-for-play signal. the defense cannot decline the runoff, but either team can use a remaining timeout to prevent it. section 8 extension of a period or a half article 1. ball in play. if time expires at the end of any period while the ball is in play, the period continues until the down ends. article 2. period extended. at the election of the opponent, a period may be extended for one untimed down, if any of the following occurs during a down during which time in the period expires, or during which the period had been extended pursuant to this article: (a) if there is a live-ball foul by the defensive team that is accepted, the offensive team may choose to extend the period by an untimed down after enforcement of the penalty. if the first or third period is not so extended, any accepted penalty is enforced before the start of the succeeding period. (b) if there is a foul by the offense, there shall be no extension of the period. if the foul occurs on the last play of the half, a score by the offense is not counted. however, the period may be extended for an untimed down, upon the request of the defense, if the offensive team’s foul is for: (1) illegal touching of a kick; note: the period may also be extended for a “first touching” violation. (2) fair-catch interference; (3) a palpably unfair act; (4) a personal foul or unsportsmanlike conduct foul committed during a down prior to a safety, an interception of a forward pass, the recovery of a backward pass or fumble, or the offensive team failing to reach the line to gain on fourth down; or (5) a foul by the kicking team prior to a player of the receiving team securing possession of the ball during a down in which there is a safety kick, a scrimmage kick, or a free kick. (c) if a touchdown is made on the last play of a period, the try attempt shall be made (except during a sudden-death period, or if a touchdown is scored during a down in which time in the fourth period expires, and a successful try would not affect the outcome of the game). (d) if no fair-catch signal is given and the kickers interfere with the receiver’s opportunity to catch a kick, the receiving team may extend the period by a down from scrimmage. (e) if a fair-catch is signaled and made, the receivers may choose to extend the period by a fair-catch kick down (10-2-4-a). if the first or third period is not so extended, the receivers may start the succeeding period by either a down from scrimmage or fair-catch kick (11-4-3). (f) if a fair catch is signaled and the kickers interfere with a receiver’s opportunity to catch a kick, the receiving team may extend the period by either a down from scrimmage or a fair-catch kick (10-2-4-a). (g) if a safety results from a foul during the last play of a half, the score counts. a safety kick is made if requested by the receivers. (h) if a double foul occurs during the last down of either half, the period shall be extended by an untimed down. exceptions: the half is not extended if: (1) both fouls are dead-ball fouls; (2) there is a major-minor double foul (“5 vs. 15”), and the major foul is by the offense, or if the major foul is a dead ball foul by the defense (see 14-5-1-exc. 1); or 16rule 4 note: if the 15-yard penalty is for a dead-ball personal, unsportsmanlike conduct, or taunting foul by either team the penalty yardage will be enforced on the second half kickoff or the kickoff to start overtime. there will be no extension of the period (14-4-9-exc. 1). (3) there is a double foul with a change of possession (“clean hands” rule, see 14-5-2) that does not involve a replay of the down. if a double foul occurs on the last play of the first or third periods, the period is not extended. if the first or third period is extended for any reason, or if a touchdown occurs during the last play of such a period, any additional play, including a try attempt, shall be completed before the teams change goals. there may be more than one untimed down at the end of a period pursuant to this article. 17rule 5 players, substitutes, equipment, general rules section 1 players article 1. number of players. the game is played by two teams of 11 players each. if team a has more than 11 players in its formation for more than three seconds, or if team b has more than 11 players in its formation and the snap is imminent, it is a foul. once the ball is made ready for play, if either team has more than 11 players in its formation prior to a free kick, it is also a foul. in these instances, game officials shall blow their whistles immediately and not allow the snap or kick to occur. penalty: for more than 11 players in the formation prior to the snap or free kick: loss of five yards from the succeeding spot. if a team has more than 11 players on the field of play or the end zone when a snap, free kick, or fair-catch kick is made, the ball is in play, and it is a foul. penalty: for more than 11 players on the field of play or the end zone while the ball is in play: loss of five yards from the previous spot. note: it is not a foul if a team has fewer than 11 players on the field of play or the end zone when a snap, free kick, or fair-catch kick is made. article 2. players numbered by position. all players must wear numerals on their jerseys in accordance with rule 5, section 4, article 3, item 3. such numerals must be by playing position, as follows: (a) quarterbacks, punters, and placekickers: 1-19; (b) defensive backs: 1-49; (c) running backs, fullbacks, tight ends, h-backs, and wide receivers: 1-49 and 80-89; (d) offensive linemen: 50-79; (e) defensive linemen: 50-79 and 90-99; (f) linebackers: 1-59 and 90-99. if a player changes his position during his playing career in the nfl, and such change moves him from a position as an ineligible pass receiver to that of an eligible pass receiver, or from a position as an eligible pass receiver to that of an ineligible pass receiver, he must be issued an appropriate new jersey numeral. a change in jersey numeral is not required if the change is from an ineligible position to another ineligible position, or from an eligible position to another eligible position, provided that the player has participated at least one season at his position prior to the change. any request to wear a numeral for a special position not specified above must be made to the commissioner. during the preseason period when playing rosters are larger, the league will allow duplication and other temporary deviations from the numbering scheme specified above, but the rule must be adhered to for all players during the regular season and postseason. clubs must make numerals available to adhere to the rule, even if it requires returning to circulation a numeral that has been retired or withheld for other reasons. see 5-3-1 for reporting a change of position. section 2 substitutes and withdrawn players article 1. number of players in huddle. there can never be more than 11 players in the offensive huddle while the play clock is running. it is a foul, the whistle is blown immediately, and the ball remains dead. see 5-2-8-a. article 2. substitute becomes player. a substitute becomes a player when he: (a) participates in at least one play (including a play negated by penalty prior to the snap or during the play); or (b) is on the field of play or the end zone when a snap, fair-catch kick, or free kick is made, or when a snap, fair-catch kick, or free kick is imminent. a player becomes a substitute when he is withdrawn from the game and does not participate in at least one play. a play negated by penalty prior to the snap or during the play counts as a missed play. article 3. legal substitutions. any number of substitutes may enter the field of play or the end zone while the ball is dead. article 4. illegal substitutions. if a substitute enters the field of play or the end zone while the ball is in play, it is an illegal substitution. if an illegal substitute interferes with the play, it may be a palpably unfair act (see 12-3-4). article 5. offensive substitutions. the following are applicable to any offensive substitute who is entering the game: (a) he must move onto the field of play or the end zone as far as the inside of the field numerals prior to the snap to be a legal substitution. if he does not, and is on the field of play or end zone at the time of a legal snap, he is an illegal substitute. (b) if he approaches the huddle and communicates with a teammate, he is required to participate in at least one play before being withdrawn. after a warning, subsequent violations of this rule shall be penalized for unsportsmanlike conduct. see 5-2-11. note: the intent of the rule is to prevent teams from using simulated substitutions to confuse an opponent, while still permitting a player (or players) to enter and leave without participating in a play in certain situations, such as a change in a coaching decision on fourth down, even though he has approached the huddle and communicated with a teammate. similarly, if a player who participated in the previous play leaves the playing field by mistake, and returns to the playing field prior to the snap, he is not required to reach the inside of the field numerals, provided the defense has the opportunity to match up with him. however, a substitute (i.e., someone who did not participate in the previous play) is required to reach the inside of the field numerals. 18rule 5 article 6. withdrawn players. a player or players who have been replaced must leave the playing field or end zone on their own team’s side between the end lines prior to the next snap, free kick, or fair-catch kick. article 7. disqualified and suspended players. a player must be withdrawn and substituted for when he is disqualified (12-2, 12-3) or suspended (5-4). a suspended player may re-enter after at least one legal snap, provided that the reason for his suspension has been corrected. a disqualified player must leave the playing field enclosure and go to the team locker room within a reasonable time. article 8. penalties for illegal substitution or withdrawal. penalties are: (a) for 12 or more players in the offensive huddle (whistle blown immediately and ball remains dead): loss of five yards from the succeeding spot. (b) for a substitute entering the field during a live ball: loss of five yards. (c) for interference with the play by a substitute who enters the field during a live ball: palpably unfair act. see 12-3-4. (d) for an offensive substitute who does not move onto the field as far as the inside of the field numerals: loss of five yards from the previous spot. (e) for a withdrawn player clearing the field on the opponents’ side or across an end line: loss of five yards from the previous spot. (f) for illegal return of a suspended player: loss of five yards from the previous spot if discovery is made while the ball is in play, or five yards from the succeeding spot if discovered between downs, in which case the ball remains dead. (g) for return of a disqualified player: loss of 15 yards from the previous spot if discovery is made while the ball is in play, or 15 yards from the succeeding spot if discovered between downs, in which case the ball remains dead, and, in either case, exclusion from the playing field enclosure. note: if the illegal return of a player is not discovered until the end of a down, but prior to the start of the next one, enforcement is from the previous spot when definitely known. otherwise, enforcement is from the succeeding spot as a foul between downs. see 14-4-9. article 9. procedure following timeout or change of possession. following a timeout or change of possession, the offense may huddle outside the numbers near its bench area, but will not be allowed to line up and snap the ball before the defense has an opportunity to match personnel. if the offense snaps the ball before the defense has had an opportunity to complete its substitutions, and a defensive foul for too many players on the field results, no penalties will be enforced, except for personal fouls and unsportsmanlike conduct fouls, and the down will be replayed. at this time, the referee will notify the head coach that any further use of this tactic will result in a penalty for unsportsmanlike conduct. penalty: for unsportsmanlike conduct after a warning: loss of 15 yards from the succeeding spot. article 10. defensive matchups following substitutions. if a substitution is made by the offense, the offense shall not be permitted to snap the ball until the defense has been permitted to respond with its substitutions. while in the process of a substitution (or simulated substitution), the offense is prohibited from rushing quickly to the line of scrimmage and snapping the ball in an obvious attempt to cause a defensive foul (i.e., too many men on the field). if the offense substitutes, the following procedure will apply: (a) the umpire will stand over the ball until the referee deems that the defense has had a reasonable time to complete its substitutions. (b) if the offense snaps the ball before the defense has had an opportunity to complete its substitutions, and a defensive foul for too many players on the field results, no penalties will be enforced, except for personal fouls and unsportsmanlike conduct, and the down will be replayed. at this time, the referee will notify the head coach that any further use of this tactic will result in a penalty for unsportsmanlike conduct. the game clock will be reset to the time remaining when the snap occurred, and the clock will start on the snap. note: the quick-snap rule does not apply after the two-minute warning of either half, or if there is not a substitution by the offense. (c) on a fourth-down punting situation, the referee and the umpire will not allow a quick snap that prevents the defense from having a reasonable time to complete its substitutions. this applies throughout the entire game. (d) if the play clock expires before the defense has completed its substitution, it is delay of game by the offense. article 11. unsportsmanlike conduct. using entering substitutes, legally returning players, substitutes on sidelines, or withdrawn players to confuse opponents, or lingering by players leaving the field when being replaced by a substitute, is unsportsmanlike conduct. see 12-3-1-l. the offense is prevented from sending simulated substitutions onto the field toward its huddle and returning them to the sideline without completing the substitution in an attempt to confuse the defense. penalty: for unsportsmanlike conduct: loss of 15 yards. section 3 changes in position article 1. reporting change of position. an offensive player wearing the number of an ineligible pass receiver (50–79 and 90–99) is permitted to line up in the position of an eligible pass receiver (1–49 and 80–89), and an offensive player wearing the number of an eligible pass receiver is permitted to line up in the position of an ineligible pass receiver, provided that he immediately reports the change in his eligibility status to the referee, who will inform the defensive team. he must participate in such eligible or ineligible position as long as he is continuously in the game, but prior to each play he must again report his status to the referee, who will inform the defensive team. the game clock shall not be stopped, and the ball shall not be put in play until the referee takes his normal position. 19rule 5 note: an offensive player wearing the number of an eligible pass receiver who reports as ineligible must line up within the normal five-player core formed by ineligible players. the player cannot be more than two players removed from the middle player of a seven-player line. article 2. returning to original position. a player who has reported a change in his eligibility status to the referee is permitted to return to a position indicated by the eligibility status of his number after: (a) a team time out; (b) the end of a quarter; (c) the two-minute warning; (d) a foul; (e) a replay review; (f) a touchdown; (g) a kick from scrimmage; (h) a change of possession; or (i) if the player has been withdrawn for one legal snap. a player withdrawn for one legal snap may re-enter at a position indicated by the eligibility status of his number, unless he again reports to the referee that he is assuming a position other than that designated by the eligibility status of his number. penalty: if a player fails to notify the referee of a change in his status when required, or an offensive player with an eligible number reports as ineligible and lines up outside the tackle box: loss of five yards for illegal substitution. article 3. speakers in helmets. the coach-to-player system allows a member of the coaching staff in the bench area or the coaches’ booth to communicate to a designated offensive or defensive player with a speaker in his helmet. the communication begins once a game official has signaled a down to be over and is cut off when the play clock reaches 15 seconds or the ball is snapped, whichever occurs first. each offensive and defensive team is permitted no more than one player on the field with a speaker in his helmet. each team is permitted to have a maximum of three active radio receivers to be used on offense by its quarterbacks, and a maximum of three active radio receivers to be used on defense by players who have been designated as a primary and backup users. clubs that have a player whose principal position is as a non-quarterback (e.g., wide receiver, running back) and who also is used as a quarterback from time to time must have two helmets for that player—one with and one without radio components. when a quarterback enters the game for the first time, or re-enters the game if he has previously been in the game and removed, he must report to the referee. whenever the backup defensive user enters or re-enters the game wearing a helmet with a speaker, he must report to the umpire. if the primary defensive user subsequently re-enters the game wearing a helmet with a speaker, he must report to the umpire. if the primary and backup players have been removed from the game, no other player may wear the radio speaker in his helmet. teams must use other methods to communicate signals to their players. it is not necessary that the offensive player with the speaker in his helmet receive the snap. for special teams’ plays, only one player per team with a receiver will be permitted on the field. all players that have radio components in their helmet must have a decal, supplied by the league, displayed on the midline of the rear of the helmet. players who have speakers in their helmets must be identified in the communication system section of the game day administration report that is submitted to the referee or a member of his crew no later than one hour and 30 minutes prior to kickoff. for additional requirements and policies pertaining to the system, including regulations for the storage of a backup helmet for a non-quarterback who is used as a quarterback, or for the backup defensive player’s helmet, please refer to the policy manual for member clubs/game operations. penalty: if a player fails to notify the referee or umpire of a change in his status when required: loss of five yards for illegal substitution. section 4 equipment, uniforms, player appearance article 1. general policy. throughout the game-day period while in view of the stadium and television audience, including during team pregame warm-ups, all players must dress in a professional manner under the uniform standards. the helmet and mandatory padding referenced in article 3 below are intended to provide reasonable protection to a player while reasonably avoiding risk of injury to other players. the development of playing rules should be governed by this article. players generally must present an appearance that is appropriate to representing their individual clubs and the national football league. the term uniform, as used in this policy, applies to every piece of equipment worn by a player, including helmet, shoulder pads, thigh pads, knee pads, and any other item of protective gear, and to every visible item of apparel, including but not limited to pants, jerseys, wristbands, gloves, game socks and/or leg coverings, shoes, visible undergarments, and accessories such as headwear worn under helmets and hand towels. all visible items worn on game day by players must be issued by the club or the league, or, if from outside sources, must have approval in advance by the league office. article 2. team colors. pursuant to the official colors established for each nfl club in the league constitution and bylaws, playing squads are permitted to wear only those colors or a combination of those colors for helmets, jerseys, pants, and game socks and/or leg coverings; provided that white is also an available color for jerseys and mandatory color for the lower portion of game socks and/or leg coverings. (see 5-4-3-item 6, “game socks and/or leg coverings,” below). each player on a given team must wear the same colors on his uniform as all other players on his team in the same game. home clubs shall choose their jersey color (either white or official team color), and visiting clubs must wear the opposite. for preseason, regular season, or postseason 20rule 5 games, the two competing teams may wear jerseys in their official colors (non-white), provided the commissioner determines that such colors are of sufficient contrast. article 3. mandatory equipment, apparel. all players must wear the equipment and uniform apparel listed below, which must be of a suitably protective nature and must be designed and produced by a professional football equipment manufacturer. all components recommended by the manufacturer must be present and must not be cut, reduced in size, or otherwise altered unless for medical reasons approved in advance by the commissioner. during pregame team

leg and ankle area due to improper wear of game socks and/or leg coverings is prohibited at all times throughout the game. no other game socks and/or leg coverings, and/or opaque tape, may be worn over the one-piece, two-color uniform game socks. barefoot punters and placekickers may omit the game sock and/or leg covering of the kicking foot in preparation for and during kicking plays. item 7.

(3) if a player (kicker) is suspended for having an illegal kicking shoe, he must remain out of the game for one play, unless there is a team time out, the two-minute warning, or the end of the period. 23rule 6 free kicks section 1 procedures for a free kick article 1. free kick. a free kick is a kickoff or safety kick that puts the ball in play to start a free kick down. it must be made from any point on the kicking team’s restraining line and between the inbounds lines. (a) a kickoff puts the ball in play at the start of each half, after a try, and after a successful field goal. a dropkick or placekick may be used for a kickoff. note: during a placekick on a kickoff, the kicking team may use a manufactured tee that is one inch in height and approved by the league. once the ball has been placed on the kicking tee, the kicking tee cannot be moved. if the ball falls off the tee, the covering officials must stop play and restart the timing process without penalty to the kicking team. if the ball falls off the tee a second time during the same free kick down, the kicking team then must either use a player to hold the ball or must kick it off the ground. the ball may be placed on the ground leaning against the tee, provided the tee is in its normal upright position. (b) a safety kick puts the ball in play after a safety. a dropkick, placekick, or punt may be used for a safety kick. a tee cannot be used for a safety kick. penalty: for illegal kick on a free kick down: loss of five yards. article 2. restraining lines. the restraining lines for a free kick shall be as follows, unless they are adjusted because of a distance penalty: (a) the restraining line for the kicking team shall be its 35-yard line for a kickoff and its 20-yard line for a safety kick. (b) the restraining line for the receiving team shall be the yard line 10 yards in advance of the kicking team’s restraining line. article 3. free kick formation. when the ball is kicked on a free kick down: (a) from the time the kicker begins his approach to the ball and until the ball is kicked, (1) all kicking team players other than the kicker must be lined up with at least one foot on the yard line that is one yard behind their restraining line, and both feet must remain on the ground until the ball is kicked; and (2) no more than five players of the kicking team may be on either side of the ball; and (3) at least two players (other than a holder) must be lined up inbounds between the sideline and the bottom (outside) of the yard-line number, and at least two players (other than a holder) must be lined up between the top (inside) of the yard-line number and the inbounds lines. note: a holder for a free kick counts as one of the required five players on either side of the ball, regardless of where he is positioned. the holder is never counted as one of the required two players between the inbounds line and the top (inside) of the numbers, regardless of where he is positioned. (b) all kicking team players must be inbounds and behind the ball when it is kicked, except: (1) the holder of a placekick (3-18-1-item 2) may be beyond the line, and (2) the kicker may be beyond the line, provided that his kicking foot is not beyond the line. (c) until the ball is kicked, all receiving team (team b) players must be inbounds and behind their restraining line, and at least eight, but no more than nine, players must be positioned between their restraining line and a spot 15 yards behind their restraining line (the “setup zone”). (see section 2, article 1, item 2-b). penalty: for a player being beyond the restraining line when the ball is kicked (offside), a player being out of bounds when the ball is kicked, or either team being in an illegal formation when the ball is kicked: loss of five yards. (d) prior to the ball being touched by the receiving team or the end of the kick, it is a foul if a kicking team player voluntarily goes out of bounds (without being contacted by a receiving team player) to avoid a block. penalty: for voluntarily going out of bounds without contact: loss of 5 yards. article 4. catch or recovery of a free kick. the following applies to the catch or recovery of a free kick: (a) if a player of the receiving team catches or recovers the ball, he may advance. (b) if the ball is declared dead while in the simultaneous possession of two opposing players, the ball is awarded to the receiving team. (c) a player of the kicking team may legally touch, catch, or recover the ball if: (1) it first touches a receiving team player; or (2) it reaches or crosses the receiving team’s restraining line. (d) the ball is dead if: (1) it is caught or recovered by a player of the kicking team. if the catch or recovery is legal, the ball belongs to the kicking team at the dead-ball spot. (2) it is not touched by the receiving team and touches the ground in the end zone (touchback). (e) if the ball comes to rest anywhere on the field, and no player attempts to possess it, the ball becomes dead and belongs to the receiving team at the dead-ball spot. notes: (1) a player is deemed to have not touched the ball if it is batted or illegally kicked into him by an opponent. such touching is ignored, though the bat or kick could be a foul for an illegal bat or illegal kick. (2) for illegal catch or recovery, see 6-2-4. article 5. free kick crosses goal line. it is a touchback if a free kick: (a) touches the ground in the end zone before being touched by the receiving team; (b) goes out of bounds behind the receiving team’s goal line; (c) strikes the receiving team’s goal post, uprights, or cross bar; or 24rule 6 (d) is downed in the end zone by the receiving team. article 6. end of free kick. a free kick ends when either team possesses the ball, or when the ball is dead, if that precedes possession. a running play begins when the receiving team establishes possession of the ball. section 2 other free kick fouls article 1. blocking. item 1. kicking team. (a) between the restraining lines (10 yards). until the ball is legally touched, a kicking team player may not block or use his hands or arms against an opponent between the restraining lines, except to push or pull aside a receiver who is actively attempting to obstruct his attempt to proceed downfield. after the ball is legally touched, a kicking team player may legally block an opponent, and he may use his hands and arms to push or pull an opponent out of the way in a personal attempt to recover the ball. (b) at or five yards beyond receiver’s restraining line (next five yards). until the ball is legally touched or touches the ground, a kicking team player may not block or use his hands or arms against an opponent in the area that is at or no more than five yards beyond the receiving team’s restraining line, except to push or pull aside a receiver who is actively attempting to obstruct his attempt to proceed downfield. after the ball is legally touched or touches the ground, a kicking team player may legally block an opponent anywhere, and he may use his hands and arms to push or pull an opponent out of the way in a personal attempt to recover the ball. (c) more than 15 yards beyond kicker’s restraining line. the kicking team may legally block more than 15 yards beyond its restraining line. during the kick, the kicking team is subject to the blocking restrictions of the defense. for the exception prohibiting a block in the back by the kicking team while the ball is in flight, see 12-1-3-b-note. item 2. receiving team. (a) first 15 yards. until the ball is legally touched or the ball hits the ground, no player on the receiving team may initiate a block against the kicking team in the 15-yard area between the kicking team’s restraining line and five yards behind the receiving team’s restraining line. (b) more than 15 yards beyond kicker’s restraining line. the receiving team may legally block more than 15 yards beyond the kicking team’s restraining line. (c) after the ball is kicked, receiving team players are subject to the blocking restrictions of the offense (see 12-1-1 through 12-1-3), and they may use their hands/arms legally to push or pull an opponent out of the way in a personal attempt to recover the ball. penalty: for illegal blocking or use of hands by either team: loss of 10 yards. (d) a “double-team block” is permissible only by players who were initially lined up in the setup zone at the time of the kick. any other players may not participate in a double-team block at any time during a kick or during a return. a double-team block is defined as two or more players who contact an opponent at the same time. (e) a “wedge block” is not permitted by any players at any time. a wedge block is defined as two or more players intentionally aligning shoulder-to-shoulder within two yards of each other, and who move forward together. the foul for a wedge block occurs at that point; actual contact with an opponent is not necessary. penalty: for an illegal wedge block or an illegal double-team block: loss of 15 yards. if the foul occurs during the kick, enforcement is from the spot of the foul. if the foul occurs during the return, the penalty is enforced as customary. if the foul occurs in the receiving team’s end zone during the kick, it is enforced from the previous spot. article 2. running into free kicker. a player of the receiving team is not permitted to run into the kicker before he recovers his balance. see also 12-2-8-h for personal fouls against the kicker. penalty: for running into the kicker: loss of five yards. article 3. free kick out of bounds. the kicking team may not kick the ball out of bounds or be the last to touch the ball before it goes out of bounds between the goal lines. if the receiving team is the last to touch the ball before it goes out of bounds, the receiving team puts the ball in play at the inbounds spot. penalty: for a kickoff out of bounds: the receiving team may elect to take possession of the ball 25 yards from the spot of the kick at the inbounds line on the side of the field where the ball went out of bounds, or at the out-of-bounds spot. penalty: for a safety kick out of bounds: the receiving team may elect to take possession of the ball 30 yards from the spot of the kick at the inbounds line on the side of the field where the ball went out of bounds, or at the out-of-bounds spot. article 4. free kick illegally touched. item 1. ball reaches restraining line. a player of the kicking team may not touch, catch, or recover the ball before it has reached the receiving team’s restraining line, unless it has first been touched by a receiving team player. penalty: for illegal touching of a free kick by the kicking team: loss of five yards, or the receiving team takes possession of the ball at the spot of the illegal touch. item 2. player out of bounds. if a kicking team player goes out of bounds during the kick, either of his own volition or by being legally forced out of bounds, he may not touch or recover the ball beyond the receiving team’s restraining line, unless it has first been touched by a receiving team player. if a kicking team player touches the ball before re-establishing himself legally inbounds, it is a free kick out of bounds. 25rule 6 penalty: for illegal touching of a free kick by the kicking team: loss of five yards. section 3 enforcement of fouls article 1. enforcement from previous spot. if there is a foul during a free kick, enforcement is from the previous spot, and the free kick is made again. however, if the kicking team commits a foul prior to the end of the kick, and the receiving team retains possession throughout the down, it will have the option of enforcing the penalty at the previous spot and replaying the down or adding the penalty yardage to the dead-ball spot. exceptions: (a) a personal foul (blocking) after a fair-catch signal is enforced from the spot of the foul; (b) a foul for fair-catch interference is enforced from the spot of the foul; (c) a foul for interference with the opportunity to make a catch is enforced from the spot of the foul; (d) a foul for an invalid fair catch signal is enforced from the spot of the foul; (e) a foul for an illegal double-team block, or an illegal wedge block, during the kick that does not occur in the receiving team’s end zone, is enforced from the spot of the foul; (f) for a free kick out of bounds, see section 2, article 3; (g) for a free kick illegally touched, see section 2, article 4; or (h) double fouls are enforced according to the customary rules. see 14-5. notes: (1) the dead-ball spot for free kicks that result in a touchback is the 25-yard line. (2) in (a), (d), and (e) above, if the foul occurs in team b’s end zone, the enforcement is from the previous spot. (3) in (a), (b), (c), and (e) above, if the foul is not part of a double foul and the opponent has possession at the end of the down, the foul may be enforced from the dead-ball spot. see 14-2-4. 26rule 7 ball in play, dead ball, scrimmage section 1 ball in play article 1. live ball. after the ball has been declared ready for play, it becomes a live ball when it is legally snapped or legally kicked (a free kick or fair catch kick). the ball remains dead if it is snapped or kicked before it is made ready for play. section 2 dead ball article 1. dead ball declared. an official shall declare the ball dead and the down ended: (a) when a runner is contacted by an opponent and touches the ground with any part of his body other than his hands or feet. the ball is dead the instant the runner touches the ground. a runner touching the ground with his hands or feet while in the grasp of an opponent may continue to advance; note: if, after contact by an opponent, any part of a runner’s leg above the ankle or any part of his arm above the wrist touches the ground, the runner is down. (b) when a runner is held or otherwise restrained so that his forward progress ends; (c) when a quarterback immediately drops to his knee (or simulates dropping to his knee) behind the line of scrimmage; note: if a quarterback does not immediately drop to a knee, and contact from a rushing defender is unavoidable, it is not a foul unless the defender commits some other act that would constitute unnecessary roughness. (d) when a runner declares himself down by: (1) falling to the ground or kneeling, and clearly making no immediate effort to advance; or (2) sliding. when a runner slides feet or head first or simulates sliding, the ball is dead the instant he touches the ground with anything other than his hands or his feet, or begins to simulate touching the ground; notes: (1) defenders are required to treat a sliding runner as they would a runner who is down by contact. (2) a defender must pull up when a runner begins a slide. this does not mean that all contact by a defender is illegal. if a defender has already committed himself, and the contact is unavoidable, it is not a foul unless the defender makes forcible contact into the head or neck area of the runner with the helmet, shoulder, or forearm, or commits some other act that is unnecessary roughness. (3) a runner who desires to take advantage of this protection is responsible for starting his slide before contact by a defensive player is imminent; if he does not, and waits until the last moment to begin his slide, he puts himself in jeopardy of being contacted. (e) when a runner is out of bounds; (f) when an opponent takes a ball that is in the possession of a runner who is on the ground; note: an opponent may take or grab a ball (hand to hand) in possession of a runner who is on his feet or is airborne. (g) when a forward pass (legal or illegal) is incomplete (see 8-1-4); (h) when any legal or illegal kick touches the receivers’ goal posts or crossbar, unless it scores a field goal (see 9-4-2); (i) when a loose ball comes to rest anywhere in the field, and no player attempts to recover it; the official covering the play should pause momentarily before signaling that the ball is dead. any legal (or illegal) kick is awarded to the receivers, and any other ball is awarded to the team last in possession. when awarded to a team behind a goal line, the ball is placed on the one-yard line; (j) when any legal or illegal kick is caught or recovered by the kickers, except a scrimmage kick that is kicked from behind the line and is recovered behind the line (not a try kick) (see 9-3-2-item 3 for exception); (k) when a touchdown, touchback, safety, field goal, or try has been made; (l) when any receiver catches or recovers the ball after a fair catch signal (valid or invalid) has been made, provided the ball has not been touched by an opponent, before or after it strikes the ground; (m) when an official sounds the whistle erroneously while the ball is still in play, the ball becomes dead immediately; (1) if the ball is in player possession, the team in possession may elect to put the ball in play where it has been declared dead or to replay the down. (2) if the ball is a loose ball resulting from a fumble, backward pass, or illegal forward pass, the team last in possession may elect to put the ball in play at the spot where possession was lost or to replay the down. (3) if the ball is a loose ball resulting from a legal forward pass, a free kick, a fair-catch kick, or a scrimmage kick, the ball is returned to the previous spot, and the down is replayed. (4) if there is a foul by either team during any of the above, and the team in possession at the time of the erroneous whistle elects not to replay the down, penalty enforcement is the same as for fouls during a run, forward pass, kick, fumble, and backward pass. if the team in possession elects to replay the down, all penalties will be disregarded, except for personal fouls and unsportsmanlike conduct fouls, which will be administered prior to the replaying of the down. if the down is replayed, the game clock will be reset to the time remaining when the snap occurred, and the clock will start on the snap. (n) when a fumble is recovered or caught by a teammate of the fumbling player, and the fumble occurs on a play that is subject to the “two-minute” or “fourth-down” fumble provisions (see 8-7-5 and 8-7-6); (o) when the ball is out of bounds; (p) if a loose ball in play strikes a video board, guide wire, sky cam, or any other object, the ball will be dead immediately, and the down will be replayed at the previous spot; or 27rule 7 notes: (1) if there is not an on-field ruling that the ball struck an object, the replay official is empowered to initiate a booth review, even if the event occurs prior to the two-minute warning. if, prior to the two-minute warning, no booth review is initiated by the replay official, a coach’s challenge is permitted under the established rules for such a challenge. (2) in the event the down is replayed, the game clock will be reset to the time remaining when the snap occurred, and the clock will start on the snap. all penalties will be disregarded, except for personal fouls or unsportsmanlike conduct fouls, which will be administered prior to the replaying of the down. (q) when a runner’s helmet comes completely off. note: the game clock will not stop when this occurs, and the play clock will be reset to 40 seconds. penalty enforcement following the play is as ordinary for fouls during runs or kicks. article 2. ball touches official. the ball is not dead because it touches an official who is inbounds, or because of a signal by an official other than a whistle. section 3 new series of downs article 1. new series for team a. a new series of four scrimmage downs is awarded to team a when the following conditions exist: (a) during a given series, the ball is declared dead in possession of team a while at or beyond the line to gain. (b) enforcement of a foul by team b results in the placement of the ball at or beyond the line to gain, or if the enforcement of a foul awards an automatic first down to team a. (c) if there is a change of possession during the down, and team a has possession at the end of the down. (d) the kicking team recovers a scrimmage kick anywhere in the field of play after it first has been touched beyond the line of scrimmage by the receivers. see 9-3-2-item 1. (e) the kicking team legally recovers a free kick. article 2. new series for team b. a new series of four scrimmage downs is awarded to team b when the following conditions exist: (a) team a fails to advance the ball to the line to gain during a series of downs; or (b) there is a change of possession during the down, and team b has possession at the end of the down, or has been awarded possession at the end of the down; or (c) when the ball is declared dead in possession of the receiving team after a free kick, scrimmage kick, or fair-catch kick. article 3. forward part of ball. the forward part of the ball in its position when it is declared dead in the field of play shall be the determining point in measuring any distance gained or lost. the ball shall be rotated so that its long axis is parallel to the sidelines before measuring, while maintaining the forward most point. note: when an airborne player of either team completes a catch or interception inbounds after an opponent has driven him backward, the ball is declared dead, and forward progress is awarded at the spot where initial contact by the opponent was made after the player established firm grip and control of the ball while in the air. section 4 action at or before the snap article 1. ball ready for play. after the neutral zone has been established (ball is made or declared ready for play), an offensive player may not make a false start, a defensive player may not encroach (initiate contact with a member of the offensive team) or commit a neutral zone infraction, and no player of either team may be offside when the ball is put in play. article 2. false start. it is a false start if the ball has been placed ready for play, and, prior to the snap, an offensive player who has assumed a set position charges or moves in such a way as to simulate the start of a play, or if an offensive player who is in motion makes a sudden movement toward the line of scrimmage. any quick abrupt movement by a single offensive player, or by several offensive players in unison, which simulates the start of the snap, is a false start. exception: this does not apply to an offensive player under the center who turns his head or shoulders, unless the movement is an obvious attempt to draw an opponent offside. note: see 4-6-5-d, for actions by a defensive player who attempts to cause an offensive player to commit a false start. item 1. interior lineman. it is a false start if an interior lineman (tackle to tackle) takes or simulates a three-point stance, and then changes his position or moves the hand that is on the ground. an interior lineman who is in a two-point stance is permitted to reset in a three-point stance or change his position, provided that he comes to a complete stop prior to the snap. if he does not come to a complete stop prior to the snap, it is a false start. item 2. eligible receiver. if all 11 offensive players have been set for at least one full second, and an eligible receiver who is on the line of scrimmage moves forward, it is a false start, regardless of whether the action is quick and abrupt or slow and deliberate. if an eligible receiver who is on the line of scrimmage moves backward immediately prior to the snap and does not come to a complete stop before the snap, it is a false start. any eligible receiver is permitted to change from a two-point stance to a three-point stance, or from a three-point stance to a two-point stance, provided he comes to a complete stop prior to the snap. if he does not come to a complete stop, it is a false start. item 3. player under center. it is legal for a player who has taken a position under or behind the center to go in motion, whether he has placed his hands under center, on his knees, or on the body of the center. however, it is a false start, if the action is quick 28rule 7 and abrupt. if the player fails to come to a complete stop for at least one full second prior to the ball being snapped, it is illegal motion. item 4. shotgun formation. a player who is in position to receive the snap in shotgun formation is permitted to shift his feet prior to the snap, but any quick and abrupt movement is a false start. this includes thrusting his hands forward when there is not a simultaneous snap. item 5. attempt to draw offside. any obvious attempt by the quarterback or other player in position to receive the snap to draw an opponent offside is a false start. item 6. offense not set. with the game clock running after the two-minute warning of either half, if all 11 offensive players are not set simultaneously for one full second prior to the snap, it is a false start. penalty: for a false start: loss of five yards from the line of scrimmage. the foul is enforced prior to the snap. note: the official shall blow the whistle immediately. the penalty for a false start shall be enforced regardless of whether the snap is made or there is a reaction by the defense. article 3. encroachment. it is encroachment if a defensive player enters the neutral zone and contacts an offensive player or the ball prior to the snap, or if he interferes with the ball during the snap. the play is dead immediately. penalty: for encroachment: loss of five yards from the line of scrimmage. the foul is enforced prior to the snap. article 4. neutral zone infraction. it is a neutral zone infraction when: (a) a defender moves beyond the neutral zone prior to the snap and is parallel to or beyond an offensive lineman, with an unimpeded path to the quarterback or kicker, even though no contact is made by a blocker; officials are to blow their whistles immediately (b) a defender enters the neutral zone prior to the snap, causing the offensive player(s) in close proximity (including a quarterback who is under center) to react (move) immediately to protect himself (themselves) against impending contact; officials are to blow their whistles immediately. if there is no immediate reaction by the offensive player(s) in close proximity, and the defensive player returns to a legal position prior to the snap without contacting an opponent, there is no foul. a flexed or split receiver is considered to be in close proximity if he is lined up on the side of the ball on which the violation occurs; other offensive players are considered to be in close proximity if they are within two-and-one-half positions of the defender who enters the neutral zone. if the defender is directly over the center, a quarterback under center, the center, and the guards and tackles on both sides of the center are considered to be within close proximity; if the defender is in a gap, the two offensive players on either side of the gap are considered to be within close proximity (including a quarterback under center, if applicable) (c) a player, after he has received a warning, enters the neutral zone. it is a foul, even if he returns to a legal position prior to the snap without contacting an opponent or causing a reaction (movement) by an offensive player in close proximity. note: during the last two minutes of a half, after the ball has been spotted for the succeeding down at the line of scrimmage and the offense is legally set, if the ball is snapped before all members of the defensive team are on their side of the line of scrimmage, play shall be stopped immediately, and the defensive team penalized five yards for a neutral zone infraction. penalty: for a neutral zone infraction: loss of five yards from line of scrimmage. foul is enforced prior to snap. article 5. offside. a player is offside when any part of his body is in or beyond the neutral zone or beyond a restraining line when the ball is put in play. penalty: for offside: loss of five yards. article 6. complete stop. all offensive players are required to come to a complete stop and be in a set position simultaneously for at least one full second prior to the snap. failure to do so is an illegal shift. (see 7-4-2-item 6 for such a foul after the two-minute warning of either half). article 7. shifts. the offensive team is permitted to shift and have two or more players in motion multiple times before the snap. however, after the last shift, all players must come to a complete stop and be in a set position simultaneously for at least one full second. if any eligible backfield player goes in motion (one at a time) after the last shift and comes to a complete stop, there is no requirement for a full second pause before a second player can legally go in motion. however, if the first player has not come to a complete stop when the second player goes in motion, it is another shift and requires another simultaneous stop for at least one full second by all players. it is also an illegal shift if a player under or behind center goes in motion and fails to come to a complete stop for at least one full second before a second player goes in motion. note: the offensive team must present a legal formation both before and after a shift. penalty: for an illegal shift: loss of five yards. article 8. illegal motion. when the ball is snapped, one player who is lined up in the backfield may be in motion, provided that he is moving parallel to or away from the line of scrimmage. no player is permitted to be moving toward the line of scrimmage when the ball is snapped. all other players must be stationary in their positions. if an eligible receiver who is on the line moves to another position on the line (not forward), he must come to a complete stop prior to the snap. if he does not come to a complete stop, it is illegal motion. 29rule 7 it is also illegal motion if a player under or behind center goes in motion and fails to come to a complete stop for at least one full second prior to the snap. penalty: for a player illegally in motion at the snap: loss of five yards. section 5 position of players at the snap article 1. offensive team. the offensive team must be in compliance with the following at the snap: (a) it must have seven or more players on the line (3-19) (b) eligible receivers must be on both ends of the line, and all of the players on the line between them must be ineligible receivers (c) no player may be out of bounds note: offensive linemen may lock legs. penalty: for illegal formation by the offense: loss of five yards. section 6 putting the ball in play article 1. ball in play. the offensive team must put the ball in play with a snap at the spot where the previous down ended, unless the enforcement of a penalty moves the ball to another spot or the down ended outside the inbounds lines. if a fair-catch kick is chosen after a fair catch, 10-2-1 and 11-4-3 apply. article 2. snap at inbounds spot. the ball is next put in play (snap) at the inbounds spot by the team entitled to possession (7-1-1 and 7-4-1) when: (a) a loose ball is out of bounds between the goal lines exception: the ball is next put in play at the previous spot if a forward pass is incomplete. (b) a runner is out of bounds between the goal lines (c) the ball is dead in a side zone (d) the ball is placed in the side zone as the result of a penalty enforcement (e) a fair catch is made or awarded in a side zone article 3. restrictions for snapper. the snap (3-32) may be made by any offensive player who is on the line of scrimmage but must conform to the following provisions: (a) the snap must start with the ball on the ground, with its long axis at right angles to the line. (b) it is not necessary that the snap be between the snapper’s legs, but it must be one quick and continuous motion of the hand or hands of the snapper. the ball must leave or be taken from his hands during this motion. (c) the snapper may not snap the ball after it is ready for play until all of the officials have had a reasonable time to assume their normal positions. if this occurs, the ball remains dead, and no penalty is assessed unless it is a repeated act after a warning (delay of game). penalty: for illegally snapping the ball: loss of five yards from the line of scrimmage. article 4. legal snap. a snap is a backward pass. the snap must be received by a player who is not on the line at the snap, unless the ball first strikes the ground. if the ball first strikes the ground, or is muffed by an eligible backfield receiver, or quarterback under center, it can be recovered and advanced by any player. penalty: for snapping the ball to an ineligible snap receiver: loss of five yards from the line of scrimmage. the whistle shall be blown immediately. 30 rule 8 forward pass, backward pass, fumble section 1 forward pass article 1. definition. it is a forward pass if: (a) the ball initially moves forward (to a point nearer the opponent’s goal line) after leaving the passer’s hand(s) (b) the ball first strikes the ground, a player, an official, or anything else at a point that is nearer the opponent’s goal line than the point at which the ball leaves the passer’s hand(s). note: a ball that is intentionally fumbled and goes forward is a forward pass. a ball that is intentionally muffed, and goes forward or backward, is a batted ball (12-5-1-note). item 1. forward movement of hand. when a player is in control of the ball and is attempting to pass it forward, any intentional forward movement of his hand starts a forward pass. (a) if contact by an opponent materially affects a passer after the passer begins his throwing motion, it is a forward pass if he passes the ball, regardless of where the ball strikes the ground, a player, an official, or anything else. when this occurs, intentional grounding rules do not apply. (b) when a passer intends to throw a forward pass and is contacted by an opponent before beginning his throwing motion, the direction of the pass is the responsibility of the passer if he passes the ball, and intentional grounding rules apply. (c) if, after an intentional forward movement of his hand, the passer loses possession of the ball during an attempt to bring it back toward his body, it is a fumble. (d) if the passer loses possession of the ball while attempting to re-cock his arm, it is a fumble. article 2. legal forward pass. the offensive team may make one forward pass from behind the line during each down. if the ball, whether in player possession or loose, crosses the line of scrimmage, a forward pass is not permissible, regardless of whether the ball returns behind the line of scrimmage before the pass is thrown. item 1. illegal passes. any other forward pass by either team is illegal and is a foul by the passing team, including: (a) a forward pass thrown when the passer is beyond the line of scrimmage. note: it is a forward pass from beyond the line of scrimmage if the passer’s entire body and the ball are beyond the line of scrimmage when the ball is released, whether the passer is airborne or touching the ground. the penalty for a forward pass thrown from beyond the line is enforced from the spot where the ball is released. (b) a second forward pass thrown from behind the line of scrimmage. (c) a forward pass thrown after the ball has crossed the line of scrimmage and has returned behind it. (d) a forward pass thrown after there has been a change of possession. item 2. intercepted illegal pass. if an illegal pass is caught or intercepted, the ball may be advanced and the penalty declined. penalties: (a) for a forward pass from beyond the line: loss of down and five yards from the spot of the pass. see s.n. below. (b) for a second forward pass from behind the line, or for a forward pass that was thrown after the ball returned behind the line: loss of down and five yards from the previous spot. (c) for a forward pass that is thrown after a change of possession: loss of five yards from the spot of the pass. notes: (1) eligibility, pass interference, and intentional grounding rules apply when a forward pass is thrown from behind the line, regardless of whether the pass is an illegal forward pass. eligibility, pass interference, and intentional grounding rules do not apply if a forward pass is thrown (a) from beyond the line, (b) on a free kick play, (c) on a fair catch kick play, or (d) after a change of possession. (2) roughing the passer rules apply on all passes (legal or illegal) thrown from behind the line of scrimmage (12-2-9). if a pass is thrown from beyond the line of scrimmage, unnecessary roughness may apply for action against the passer. (3) when a distance penalty in penalty (a) leaves the ball in advance of the necessary line to gain, it is first-and-10 for the offensive team. (4) see 3-2-4 for the definition of team possession during a forward pass (a loose ball), or for when possession ends. article 3. completed or intercepted pass. a player who makes a catch may advance the ball. a forward pass is complete (by the offense) or intercepted (by the defense) in the field of play, at the sideline, or in the end zone if a player, who is inbounds: (a) secures control of the ball in his hands or arms prior to the ball touching the ground; and (b) touches the ground inbounds with both feet or with any part of his body other than his hands; and (c) after (a) and (b) have been fulfilled, performs any act common to the game (e.g., tuck the ball away, extend it forward, take an additional step, turn upfield, or avoid or ward off an opponent), or he maintains control of the ball long enough to do so. notes: (1) movement of the ball does not automatically result in loss of control. (2) if a player, who satisfied (a) and (b), but has not satisfied (c), contacts the ground and loses control of the ball, it is an incomplete pass if the ball hits the ground before he regains control, or if he regains control out of bounds. (3) a receiver is considered a player in a defenseless posture (see rule 12, section 2, article 9) throughout the entire process of the catch and until the player is capable of avoiding or warding off the impending contact of an opponent. (4) if a pass is caught simultaneously by two eligible opponents, and both players retain it, the ball belongs to the passers. it is not a simultaneous catch if a player gains control first and an opponent subsequently gains joint control. if the ball is 31rule 8 muffed after simultaneous touching by two such players, all the players of the passing team become eligible to catch the loose ball. (5) if a player, who is in possession of the ball, is held up and carried out of bounds by an opponent before both feet or any part of his body other than his hands touches the ground inbounds, it is a completed or intercepted pass. it is not necessary for the player to maintain control of the ball when he lands out of bounds. article 4. incomplete pass. any forward pass (legal or illegal) is incomplete and the ball is dead immediately if the pass strikes the ground or goes out of bounds. an incomplete pass is a loss of down, and the ball returns to the previous spot. note: if there is any question whether a forward pass is complete, intercepted, or incomplete, it is to be ruled incomplete. article 5. eligible receivers. the following players are eligible to catch a forward pass that is thrown from behind the line of scrimmage. (a) defensive players. (b) offensive players who are on either end of the line, provided they either have the numbers of eligible players (1–49 and 80–89) or have legally reported to play a position on the end of the line. see 5-1-2. (c) offensive players who are legally at least one yard behind the line at the snap, provided they either have the numbers of eligible players (1–49 and 80–89) or have legally reported to play a position in the backfield. (d) all offensive players after the ball has been touched by any defensive player or any eligible offensive player. article 6. ineligible receivers. all offensive players other than those identified in article 5 above are ineligible to catch a legal or illegal forward pass thrown from behind the line of scrimmage, including: (a) players who are not on either end of their line or at least one yard behind it when the ball is snapped. (b) offensive players wearing numbers 50–79, unless they have reported a change in their eligibility status to the referee and have assumed a position on the end of their line or in their backfield as required by article 5; (c) players who fail to notify the referee of being eligible when required; (d) an eligible receiver who has been out of bounds prior to or during a pass, even if he has re-established himself inbounds with both feet or with any part of his body other than his hands. exception: if an eligible receiver is forced out of bounds by a foul by a defender, including illegal contact, defensive holding, or defensive pass interference, provided he attempts to return inbounds immediately, he becomes eligible to legally touch the pass (without prior touching by another eligible receiver or defender) as soon as he re-establishes himself inbounds with both feet or with any part of his body other than his hands. see article 8, note 3. (e) a player who takes his stance behind center as a t-formation quarterback is not an eligible receiver unless, before the ball is snapped, he legally moves to a position at least one yard behind the line of scrimmage or on the end of the line, and is stationary in that position for at least one second before the snap. note: if he leaves his position behind the center and does not receive the snap, it is illegal motion unless he has been stationary for at least one full second prior to the snap. article 7. legal touching. a forward pass (legal or illegal) thrown from behind the line may be touched by any eligible player. a pass in flight may be tipped, batted, or deflected in any direction by any eligible player at any time, including such a pass in the end zone. article 8. illegal touching of a forward pass. it is a foul for illegal touching if a forward pass (legal or illegal) thrown from behind the line of scrimmage: (a) is first touched intentionally or is caught by an originally ineligible offensive player; or penalty: loss of five yards at the previous spot. (b) first touches or is caught by an eligible offensive receiver who has gone out of bounds, either of his own volition or by being legally forced out of bounds, and has re-established himself inbounds. penalty: loss of down at the previous spot. notes: (1) if a forward pass (legal or illegal) is caught by an ineligible offensive player, the ball remains alive. (2) the bat of a pass in flight by any player does not end a pass, nor does it change the impetus if the bat sends it in touch. (3) if a player touches the ball after having been out of bounds, but prior to re-establishing himself inbounds with both feet or any part of his body other than his hands, the pass is incomplete, and there is no penalty for illegal touching. section 2 intentional grounding article 1. definition. it is a foul for intentional grounding if a passer, facing an imminent loss of yardage because of pressure from the defense, throws a forward pass without a realistic chance of completion. a realistic chance of completion is defined as a pass that is thrown in the direction of and lands in the vicinity of an originally eligible offensive receiver. item 1. passer or ball outside tackle position. intentional grounding will not be called when a passer, who is outside, or has been outside, the tackle position, throws a forward pass that lands at or beyond the line of scrimmage, even if no offensive player(s) have a realistic chance to catch the ball (including when the ball lands out of bounds over the sideline or endline). if the ball crosses the line of scrimmage (extended) beyond the sideline, there is no intentional grounding. if a loose ball leaves the area bordered by the tackles, this area no longer exists; if the ball is recovered, all intentional grounding rules apply as if the passer is outside this area. item 2. physical contact. intentional grounding should not be called if: 32rule 8 (a) the passer initiates his passing motion toward an eligible receiver and then is significantly affected by physical contact from a defensive player that causes the pass to land in an area that is not in the direction and vicinity of an eligible receiver; or (b) the passer is out of the pocket, and his passing motion is significantly affected by physical contact from a defensive player that causes the ball to land short of the line of scrimmage. item 3. stopping clock. a player under center is permitted to stop the game clock legally to save time if, immediately upon receiving the snap, he begins a continuous throwing motion and throws the ball directly into the ground. item 4. delayed spike. a passer, after delaying his passing action for strategic purposes, is prohibited from throwing the ball to the ground in front of him, even though he is under no pressure from defensive rusher(s). penalty: for intentional grounding: (a) loss of down and 10 yards from the previous spot; or (b) loss of down at the spot of the pass; or (c) if the passer is in his end zone when the ball is thrown, it is a safety. see 4-7 for actions to conserve time inside two minutes of either half. note: if the foul occurs less than 10 yards behind the line of scrimmage, but more than half the distance to the goal line, the ball is to be placed at the spot of the pass. section 3 ineligible player downfield article 1. legal and illegal acts. on a scrimmage play during which a legal forward pass is thrown, an ineligible offensive player, including a t-formation quarterback, is not permitted to move more than one yard beyond the line of scrimmage before the pass has been thrown. item 1. legally downfield. an ineligible player is not illegally downfield if, after initiating contact with an opponent within one yard of the line of scrimmage during his initial charge: (a) he moves more than one yard beyond the line while legally blocking or being blocked by an opponent (b) after breaking legal contact with an opponent more than one yard beyond the line of scrimmage, he remains stationary until a forward pass is thrown (c) after losing legal contact with an opponent more than one yard beyond the line of scrimmage, he is forced behind the line of scrimmage by an opponent, at which time he is again subject to normal blocking restrictions for an ineligible offensive player. note: if an ineligible offensive player moves beyond the line while legally blocking or being blocked by an opponent, an eligible offensive player may catch a pass between them and the line of scrimmage. item 2. illegally downfield. an ineligible offensive player is illegally downfield if: (a) he moves more than one yard beyond the line of scrimmage without contacting an opponent (b) after losing contact with an opponent within one yard of the line of scrimmage, he advances more than one yard beyond the line of scrimmage (c) after losing contact with an opponent more than one yard beyond the line of scrimmage, he continues to move toward his opponent’s goal line. penalty: for ineligible offensive player downfield: loss of five yards from the previous spot. note: an ineligible offensive player is illegally downfield when his entire body is more than one yard beyond the line of scrimmage. article 2. after pass is thrown. after the ball leaves the passer’s hand, ineligible pass receivers can advance more than one yard beyond the line of scrimmage, or beyond the position reached by their initial charge, provided that they do not block or contact a defensive player, who is more than one yard beyond the line of scrimmage, until the ball is touched by a player of either team. such prior blocking and/or contact is pass interference if it occurs in the vicinity of where the ball is thrown. see 8-3-1-note above for exception when blocker maintains continuous contact. section 4 legal and illegal contact with eligible receivers article 1. legal contact within five yards. within the area five yards beyond the line of scrimmage, a defensive player may chuck an eligible receiver in front of him. the defender is allowed to maintain continuous and unbroken contact within the five-yard zone, so long as the receiver has not moved beyond a point that is even with the defender. article 2. illegal contact within five yards. within the five-yard zone, if the player who receives the snap remains in the pocket with the ball, a defender may not make original contact in the back of a receiver, nor may he maintain contact after the receiver has moved beyond a point that is even with the defender. note: if a defender contacts a receiver within the five-yard zone of the line of scrimmage, loses contact, and then contacts him again within the five-yard zone, it is a foul for illegal contact. article 3. illegal contact beyond five-yard zone. beyond the five-yard zone, if the player who receives the snap remains in the pocket with the ball, a defender cannot initiate contact with a receiver who is attempting to evade him. a defender may use his hands or arms only to defend or protect himself against impending contact caused by a receiver. note: if a defender contacts a receiver within the five-yard zone and maintains contact with him, he must release the receiver as they exit the five-yard zone. if the defender maintains contact beyond five yards, it is illegal contact. article 4. incidental contact beyond five-yard zone. beyond the five-yard zone, incidental contact may exist between receiver and defender. 33rule 8 penalty: for illegal contact by the defense: loss of five yards and automatic first down. article 5. illegal cut block. it is an illegal cut block if: (a) an eligible receiver who takes a position more than two yards outside of his own tackle (flexed receiver) is blocked below the waist at, behind, or beyond the line of scrimmage; or (b) an eligible receiver who is lined up within two yards of the tackle, whether on or behind the line, is blocked below the waist after he goes beyond the line of scrimmage (such players may be blocked below the waist at or behind the line of scrimmage). penalty: for illegal cut block: loss of 15 yards and automatic first down. article 6. defensive holding. it is defensive holding if a player grasps an eligible offensive player (or his jersey) with his hands, or extends an arm or arms to cut off or encircle him. see 12-1-6. penalty: for holding by the defense: loss of five yards and automatic first down. note: any offensive player who pretends to possess the ball, and/or one to whom a teammate pretends to give the ball, may be tackled until he crosses the line of scrimmage between the offensive tackles of a normal tight offensive line. article 7. end of restrictions. if the quarterback or the receiver of the snap demonstrates no further intention to pass the ball (i.e., hands off or pitches the ball to another player, throws a forward or backward pass, loses possession of the ball by a muff that touches the ground or a fumble, or if he is tackled) the restrictions on the defensive team prohibiting illegal contact, or an illegal cut block, against an eligible receiver will end, and a defensive player is permitted to use his hands, arms, or body to push, pull, or ward off an offensive receiver, pursuant to rule 12, section 1, article 5. if the quarterback leaves the pocket area with the ball in his possession, the restrictions on illegal contact and an illegal cut block both end, but the restriction on defensive holding remains in effect. if a team presents an apparent punting formation, defensive acts that normally constitute illegal contact (chuck beyond five yards, etc.) are permitted, provided that the acts do not constitute defensive holding. section 5 pass interference article 1. definition. it is pass interference by either team when any act by a player more than one yard beyond the line of scrimmage significantly hinders an eligible player’s opportunity to catch the ball. pass interference can only occur when a forward pass is thrown from behind the line of scrimmage, regardless of whether the pass is legal or illegal, or whether it crosses the line. defensive pass interference rules apply from the time the ball is thrown until the ball is touched. see article 2 for prohibited acts while the ball is in the air. offensive pass interference rules apply from the time the ball is snapped until the ball is touched. see article 2 for prohibited acts while the ball is in the air and article 4 for prohibited acts prior to the pass. article 2. prohibited acts by both teams while the ball is in the air. acts that are pass interference include, but are not limited to: (a) contact by a player who is not playing the ball that restricts the opponent’s opportunity to make the catch; (b) playing through the back of an opponent in an attempt to make a play on the ball; (c) grabbing an opponent’s arm(s) in such a manner that restricts his opportunity to catch a pass; (d) extending an arm across the body of an opponent, thus restricting his ability to catch a pass, and regardless of whether the player committing such act is playing the ball; (e) cutting off the path of an opponent by making contact with him, without playing the ball; (f) hooking an opponent in an attempt to get to the ball in such a manner that it causes the opponent’s body to turn prior to the ball arriving; or (g) initiating contact with an opponent by shoving or pushing off, thus creating separation. note: if there is any question whether player contact is incidental, the ruling should be no interference. article 3. permissible acts by both teams while the ball is in the air. acts that are permissible by a player include, but are not limited to: (a) incidental contact by an opponent’s hands, arms, or body when both players are competing for the ball, or neither player is looking for the ball. if there is any question whether contact is incidental, the ruling shall be no interference. (b) inadvertent tangling of feet when both players are playing the ball or neither player is playing the ball. (c) contact that would normally be considered pass interference, but the pass is clearly uncatchable by the involved players, except as specified in 8-3-2 and 8-5-4 pertaining to blocking downfield by the offense. (d) laying a hand on an opponent that does not restrict him in an attempt to make a play on the ball. (e) contact by a player who has gained position on an opponent in an attempt to catch the ball. notes: (1) when the ball is in the air, eligible offensive and defensive receivers have the same right to the path of the ball and are subject to the same restrictions. (2) acts that do not occur more than one yard beyond the line of scrimmage are not pass interference, but could be offensive or defensive holding (see 12-1-3 and 12-1-6). (3) whenever a team presents an apparent punting formation and until the ball is kicked, defensive acts that normally constitute pass interference are permitted against the end man on the line of scrimmage, or against an eligible receiver behind the line of scrimmage who is aligned or in motion more than one yard outside the end man on the line, provided that the acts do not constitute illegal holding. defensive holding, such as tackling a receiver, still can be called and result in a five-yard penalty from the previous spot, if accepted. offensive pass interference rules still apply. 34rule 8 article 4. other prohibited acts by the offense. blocking more than one yard beyond the line of scrimmage by an offensive player prior to a pass being thrown is offensive pass interference. see 8-3-1-item 1 for exception for an ineligible offensive player. note: it is also pass interference by the offense to block a defender beyond the line while the pass is in the air, if the block occurs in the vicinity of the player to whom the pass is thrown. see 8-3-1-note for exception for ineligible players. penalty: for pass interference by the defense: first down for the offensive team at the spot of the foul. if the interference is also a personal foul (12-2), the 15-yard penalty for such a foul is also enforced, either from the spot of the foul (for interference), or from the end of the run if the foul for pass interference is declined. if the interference is behind the defensive goal line, it is first down for the offensive team on the defense’s one-yard line, or, if the previous spot was inside the two-yard line, halfway between the previous spot and the goal line. penalty: for pass interference by the offense: loss of 10 yards from the previous spot. section 6 enforcement spot article 1. enforcement spot. if there is a foul by either team from the time of the snap until a forward pass thrown from behind the line ends, the penalty is enforced from the previous spot. a pass play ends and a running play begins at the instant that a pass is caught. exceptions: (a) pass interference by the defense is enforced from the spot of the foul. if it occurs in the fouling team’s end zone, the ball will be placed at the one-yard line, or half the distance to the goal line from the previous spot, whichever is more beneficial to the offense. (b) intentional grounding is a loss of down at the spot of the foul, or a loss of down and a 10-yard penalty from the previous spot, whichever is less beneficial for the offense. see 8-2-1-penalty. (c) if there is a personal foul or unsportsmanlike conduct foul by the defense prior to completion of a forward pass thrown from behind the line, enforcement is from the previous spot or the dead-ball spot, whichever is more beneficial to the offense. if the play results in a score for the offense, enforcement is on the ensuing kickoff or try. if the passing team is fouled and subsequently loses possession after a completion, the passing team retains possession of the ball, and enforcement is from the previous spot. (d) if there is a personal foul or unsportsmanlike conduct foul by the offense prior to an interception of a forward pass thrown from behind the line, enforcement is from the dead-ball spot. if the intercepting team subsequently loses possession, the penalty is enforced from the spot of the interception, and the intercepting team retains possession. (e) it is a safety when the offensive team commits a foul behind its own goal line. note: when the dead-ball spot is normally a touchback, enforcement is from the 20-yard line. section 7 backward pass and fumble article 1. backward pass. a runner may throw a backward pass at any time (3-22-5). players of either team may advance after catching a backward pass, or recovering a backward pass after it touches the ground. exception: see actions to conserve time (4-7-1). note: a direct snap from center to a player in the backfield, a muffed hand-to-hand snap, or a snap that is untouched by any player are backward passes, and the ball remains alive. article 2. backward pass out of bounds. if a backward pass goes out of bounds between the goal lines, the ball is dead (7-6-2-a), and it is next put in play at the inbounds spot. rule 11 governs if a backward pass is declared dead behind the goal line. article 3. fumble. a fumble is any act, other than a pass or kick, which results in a loss of player possession. exception: if a runner intentionally fumbles forward, it is a forward pass (3-22). item 1. recovery and advance. any player of either team may recover or catch a fumble and advance, either before or after the ball strikes the ground. exceptions: (a) fourth-down fumble. see 8-7-5 below.

(for the exception prohibiting a block in the back by the kicking team while the ball is in flight, see 12-1-3-b-note). after the kick ends, both teams are subject to the normal restrictions applicable to offense and defense. exception: if the ball does not go beyond the line of scrimmage, or goes beyond the line of scrimmage and returns behind the line untouched by the receiving team beyond the line, the blocking restrictions do not change, and the kicking team continues to be subject to the blocking restrictions of the offense and the receiving team to the blocking restrictions of the defense. (d) after the ball has been kicked and goes beyond the line of scrimmage, and until the kick ends (either team secures possession of the ball, or the ball is dead by rule), the penalty yardage for holding and illegal use of hands fouls by either team shall be 10 yards. 37rule 9 note: it is a foul for unnecessary roughness if a player of the receiving team goes out of bounds and blocks a kicking team player who is out of bounds. (12-2-8-c) article 5. kicking team player voluntarily out of bounds. during a scrimmage kick that crosses the line of scrimmage, and prior to the end of the kick, it is a foul if a kicking team player goes out of bounds voluntarily (without being contacted by a receiving team player) to avoid a block by a receiving team player. penalty: loss of five yards. if a member of the kicking team is forced out of bounds, or goes out of bounds voluntarily, and does not attempt to return inbounds in a reasonable amount of time, it is a foul for unsportsmanlike conduct. (12-3-1-v) section 2 touching a scrimmage kick article 1. touching behind the line. any touching of the ball behind the line of scrimmage by a kicking team player is legal, even if the ball has crossed the line and returns behind the line. article 2. first touching beyond the line. “first touching” is when a player of the kicking team touches a scrimmage kick in the field of play that is beyond the line of scrimmage before it has been touched by a player of the receiving team beyond the line. if the ball is first touched by a player of the kicking team, it remains in play. first touching is a violation, and the receivers shall have the option of taking possession of the ball at the spot of first touching, provided no live-ball penalty is accepted on the play, or at the spot where the ball is dead. first touching does not offset a foul by the receivers; if there is a live-ball foul by the receivers that is enforced, either before or after the first touching violation, the violation is disregarded, and the penalty is enforced as customary. notes: (1) if the receiving team gains possession, subsequently loses possession, and fouls after the kicking team gains possession, the spot of first touching is disregarded, and the kicking team retains possession. enforcement of the receiving team’s foul is as customary. (2) there may be multiple “first touch” spots if the kicking team touches the ball multiple times before it is touched by a player of the receiving team. (3) a team b player is deemed not to have touched a kick if such touching occurs in the immediate vicinity of the line in an attempt to block the kick. (4) if a player of the kicking team touches the goal line with any part of his body while touching the ball, the ball is dead, and the result of the play is a touchback. (5) the spot of first touching is normally the yard line at which the ball is when touched. if the first touching occurs while the ball is in the air above or beyond the goal line, and prior to the ball touching the goal line or the ground beyond the goal line, the spot of first touching is deemed to be the spot from which the touching player left the field of play, but in no event inside the receiving team’s one-yard line. article 3. kicking team player out of bounds. a player of the kicking team, who has gone out of bounds during the kick, either of his own volition or by being legally forced out of bounds, may not touch or recover a scrimmage kick beyond the line of scrimmage until it has been touched by a kicking team player who has not been out of bounds, or until it has been touched by a player of the receiving team beyond the line. note: if a player touches or recovers the ball before he has re-established himself inbounds, the ball is out of bounds at the spot of the touch, and there is no foul. penalty: for illegal touching of a scrimmage kick: loss of five yards. if the illegal touching is inside the receiver’s five-yard line, in addition to the other specified options, the receiving team may elect to take a touchback. article 4. blocked into kick. there is no distinction between a player touching a ball or being touched by it, but a player is not considered to have touched the ball if he is blocked into it by an opponent, provided he is in a passive position and not blocking. a player who is engaged with and blocking his opponent when he contacts the ball is deemed to have touched the ball. article 5. ball batted or illegally kicked into opponent. a receiving team player is deemed to have not touched the ball if it is batted or illegally kicked into him by an opponent. such touching by the receiving team is disregarded, though the bat or kick could create a first touching violation or a foul for an illegal bat or illegal kick. section 3 catch or recovery of a scrimmage kick article 1. kickers catch or recover behind line. when a scrimmage kick is caught or recovered by the kicking team behind the line of scrimmage, the kicking team may advance, even if the ball has crossed the line and returned behind the line. (3-25-4) item 1. same series of downs. if the ball has returned behind the line untouched by the receiving team beyond the line, and the kicking team catches or recovers the ball, the existing series of downs continues unless the kicking team advances the ball to the line to gain, in which case there is a new series of downs. item 2. new series of downs. if the ball has returned behind the line after being touched by the receiving team beyond the line, and the kicking team catches or recovers the ball, by rule there has been a change of possession, and the kicking team will be awarded a new series of downs. article 2. kickers catch or recover beyond line. when the kickers catch or recover a kick beyond the line of scrimmage, the ball is dead at the spot of recovery, even if a member of the receiving team has first touched the ball. 38rule 9 item 1. legal catch or recovery. if the receiving team touches the ball beyond the line, a subsequent catch or recovery by the kicking team is legal, but the ball is dead. in the event of such a catch or recovery, it is first-and-10 for the kickers, or if the ball is caught or recovered by the kickers in the receiver’s end zone, it is a touchdown for the kickers. (7-3-1-d) item 2. illegal catch or recovery. if the kickers catch or recover a kick beyond the line that has not been touched beyond the line by the receiving team, the ball is dead, and it is first-and-10 for the receivers at the spot of catch or recovery (see 11-4-2 for missed goals). if a kick from behind the line is touched by the receiving team behind the line, such touching does not make the kicking team eligible to catch or recover the kick beyond the line. item 3. touchback. if a player of the kicking team illegally catches or recovers a scrimmage kick, other than a field-goal attempt from beyond the 20-yard line, and touches the goal line with any part of his body while in possession of the ball, the ball is dead, and the result of the play is a touchback. for a missed field goal from beyond the 20-yard line, see 11-4-2. article 3. receivers catch or recovery. if the receivers catch or recover any kick, they may advance. for fair catch exception, see 10-2. for exception for a ball that has crossed the goal line, see 9-4-1. article 4. simultaneous catch or recovery. when a legal kick is simultaneously caught or recovered anywhere by two eligible opposing players, or if the ball is lying on the field of play with no player attempting to recover it, it is awarded to the receivers. (7-2-1-i) section 4 ball crosses goal line, touches goal posts, out of bounds, dead in field of play article 1. ball crosses receivers’ goal line. if a scrimmage kick crosses the receiver’s goal line from the impetus of the kick, the following shall apply: (a) if the ball has not been touched by a player of the receiving team beyond the line of scrimmage, it is dead immediately, and the result of the play is a touchback, when: (1) it touches the ground on or behind the receiver’s goal line; (2) it touches a player of the kicking team who is touching the ground on or behind the receiver’s goal line; or (3) it touches a player of the kicking team who has touched the ground on or behind the receiver’s goal line and has not re-established himself in the field of play. see 11-4-2 for options for missed field goals beyond the 20-yard line. (b) if the receivers catch the ball in the end zone, or recover it in the end zone after touching it in the field of play or the end zone, they may advance. (c) if the kickers catch or recover the ball in the end zone after the receivers first touch the ball in the field of play or the end zone, it is a touchdown for the kickers. (d) if there is a spot of first touching by the kickers outside the receivers’ 20-yard line, the receiving team has the option to take possession of the ball at the spot of the first touching. (e) if the scrimmage kick is a punt, and the ball goes out of bounds in the field of play after being touched by a receiver in the end zone or in the field of play, it is the receiving team’s ball at the out-of-bounds spot. article 2. kick touches receivers’ goal posts. if a missed field goal or try, or a punt, has touched the receiver’s goal post, uprights, or crossbar, the ball is dead in the receiver’s end zone, and all customary rules pertaining to punts, missed field goals, and tries apply. article 3. kick touches kickers’ goal posts. if a scrimmage kick touches the kickers’ goal post, uprights, or crossbar, the ball is dead, and it is a safety. see 11-5-1. article 4. ball out of bounds or not recovered in field of play. if a scrimmage kick goes out of bounds between the goal lines or is lying in the field of play with no player attempting to recover it, it is the receiver’s ball at the dead-ball spot, unless the special rules for missed field goals in 11-4-2 apply. section 5 spots of enforcement article 1. spots of enforcement. if there is a foul from the time of the snap until a legal scrimmage kick ends, enforcement is from the previous spot. this includes a foul during a run prior to a legal kick, and a foul by the kicking team during a missed field-goal attempt. exceptions: (1) if the offensive team commits a foul in its own end zone, it is a safety. (2) unless the kick is a missed field-goal attempt, if there is a foul by the kicking team, the receiving team will have the option of taking the penalty at the previous spot and replaying the down, or adding the penalty yardage on to the dead-ball spot. notes: (a) the dead-ball spot for scrimmage kicks that result in a touchback is the 20-yard line. (b) if there is a foul for an illegal touch inside the five-yard line, the receiving team also has the option of accepting a touchback. (c) if there is a personal foul or unsportsmanlike conduct foul by the kicking team during a missed field-goal attempt where the receiving team is awarded the ball (see 11-4-2), enforcement is from the succeeding spot. (3) fair-catch interference, interference with the opportunity to make a catch, an invalid fair-catch signal, or a personal foul (blocking) after a fair-catch signal are enforced from the spot of the foul. note: if the foul is not part of a double foul and the opponent has possession at the end of the down, the foul may be enforced from the dead-ball spot. see 14-2-4. (4) except for fouls that are committed in an attempt to block the kick (such as running into or roughing the kicker, defensive holding (pull-and-shoot), leverage, leaping, and pushing teammate(s) into the offensive formation), if the receiving team commits a foul after the kick crosses the line of scrimmage, the penalty for its infraction will be enforced as if it had been 39rule 9 in possession of the ball at the time the foul occurred (a post-possession foul), provided that the receiving team does not lose possession of the ball at any time during the down. the penalty shall be enforced from whichever of the following spots is least beneficial to the receiving team: (a) the end of the kick; or (b) the spot of the foul. if the foul occurs in the end zone, it is deemed to have occurred at the 20-yard line, unless enforcement results in a safety (14-4-4). (5) for enforcement of a personal or unsportsmanlike conduct foul on a play that results in a score, see 14-2-3; for illegally kicking a loose ball, see 12-5-2; and for an illegal bat, see 12-5-1. when team b establishes possession of the ball, a scrimmage kick ends, and a running play begins, and fouls that occur thereafter are enforced from the dead-ball spot or the spot of the foul (three-and-one method, 14-3-6).

(e) the try ends when: (1) either team scores; (2) the ball is dead by rule; or (3) a fumble by either team is recovered by a teammate of the fumbling player. article 3. fouls committed during try. if a foul results in a retry, team a will have the option to enforce the penalty from the spot where it attempted the try (previous spot) or from the yard line for the other try option, the location of which is determined by any previously enforced penalty, if applicable. exception: defensive pass interference is a spot foul. if the foul is in the end zone, the ball will be placed on the defense’s one-yard line, or half the distance to the goal, whichever is more advantageous to team a. in addition, team a may have the penalty enforced half the distance from the other try spot. item 1. fouls before the signal. if there is a foul by either team after a touchdown and before the ready-for-play signal, it is enforced on the next kickoff or the try. 43rule 11 item 2. fouls before the snap. if there is a foul by the offense which causes a play to be whistled dead prior to the snap, it shall be treated the same as if it had occurred prior to a scrimmage play. the whistle shall be blown immediately. (see 7-4-1). if a foul by the defense prevents the attempt of a try, the offensive team has the option to have the distance penalty assessed on the next try or on the ensuing kickoff. item 3. fouls by team a. the following applies if there is a foul by team a: (a) if there is a foul by team a during a successful try, the try shall be repeated, unless the penalty results in a loss of down. (b) if the penalty for a foul results in a loss of down, the try is unsuccessful, and there shall be no replay. (c) all fouls committed after a change of possession will result in a distance penalty being assessed on the ensuing kickoff, provided the penalty does not negate a successful try. (d) all personal or unsportsmanlike conduct fouls will result in a distance penalty being assessed on the ensuing kickoff, provided the penalty does not negate a successful try. (e) if the foul results in a safety, team b is awarded one point. item 4. fouls by team b. the following applies if there is a foul by team b: (a) all fouls will result in the distance penalty being assessed on the ensuing kickoff, unless team a chooses to attempt a retry after enforcement of the penalty, or the penalty negates a score by team b. (b) if the foul results in a safety, team a is awarded one point. note: if the foul is for defensive pass interference, and it is declined, no distance penalty is enforced on the kickoff. item 5. fouls by both teams with no change of possession. if there are fouls by both teams during a try in which there is not a change of possession, the try must be replayed (14-5-1). exception: see 14-4-9-item 3-exc. 2 for enforcement when the scoring team commits a dead ball foul after a score. item 6. fouls by both teams with change of possession. if both teams foul during a try in which there is a change or changes of possession, the following shall apply: (a) if both teams foul before the first change of possession, the try shall be repeated. (b) if team b fouls before the first change of possession, the try shall be repeated. (c) if team a fouls before the first change of possession, the try shall be deemed to have failed. (d) if neither team fouls before the first change of possession, and both teams subsequently commit fouls, the try shall be deemed to have failed. item 7. fouls after a try. if there is a foul by either team after a try, it is enforced on the succeeding kickoff. if there are fouls by both teams, normal enforcement rules apply. article 4. kickoff after try. after a try, the team on defense during the try shall receive the kickoff (6-1-1-a). section 4 field goal article 1. successful field goal. a field goal is scored when all of the following conditions are met: (a) the kick must be a placekick or dropkick made by the offense from on or behind the line of scrimmage or from the spot of a fair catch (fair-catch kick). if a fair catch is made or awarded outside the inbound line, the spot of the kick is the nearest inbound line. (b) after the ball is kicked, it must not touch the ground or any player of the offensive team before it passes through the goal. (c) the entire ball must pass through the vertical plane of the goal, which is the area above the crossbar and between the uprights or, if above the uprights, between their outside edges. if the ball passes through the goal, and returns through the goal without striking the ground or some object or person beyond the goal, the attempt is unsuccessful. note: see 9-1-3 for restriction applicable to team b formation at the snap. article 2. missed field goals. if there is a missed field-goal attempt, and the ball has not been touched by the receivers beyond the line of scrimmage in the field of play, or in the end zone before the ball has touched the ground in the end zone, the following shall apply: (a) if the spot of the kick was inside the receivers’ 20-yard line, it is the receivers’ ball at the 20-yard line or (b) if the spot of the kick was from the receivers’ 20-yard line or beyond the receivers’ 20-yard line, it is the receivers’ ball at the spot of the kick. note: these options apply only if the scrimmage kick has crossed the line. exceptions: the special rules pertaining to field goals in (a) and (b) are not applicable, and all general rules for a scrimmage kick, other than penalty enforcements, will apply when there is a missed field goal and: (1) the ball is touched by the receivers beyond the line of scrimmage in the field of play or in the end zone before the ball has become dead; or (2) the scrimmage kick ends behind the line of scrimmage, and the ball has not been touched by the receivers beyond the line of scrimmage. note: if a foul occurs during an unsuccessful field-goal attempt in (1) or (2) above, rule 14-4-8 governs. supplemental notes: (1) if the receivers do not touch the ball beyond the line of scrimmage in the field of play or in the end zone, the ball is dead as soon as it touches the ground in the end zone, and it is the receivers’ ball at the spot of the kick, or at the 20-yard line if the attempt was from inside the 20-yard line. 44rule 11 (2) if the ball goes out of bounds after it is first touched by the receivers beyond the line of scrimmage in the field of play, it is the receivers’ ball at the out-of-bounds spot. (3) if the receivers first touch the ball beyond the line of scrimmage in the field of play or in the end zone, and the kickers recover, the ball belongs to the kickers at the spot of recovery. if the recovery is in the end zone, it is a touchdown. (4) if the receivers first touch the ball beyond the line of scrimmage in the field of play, and without any new impetus, the ball rolls into the end zone where it is declared dead in the possession of the receivers, it is a touchback. (5) for a successful field goal, or for an unsuccessful attempt that does not land in the field of play, the maximum amount of time that can run off the game clock is five seconds. article 3. fair-catch kick. the rules for a field-goal attempt from scrimmage apply to a field-goal attempt following a fair catch (a fair-catch kick). exceptions: (1) the fair-catch kick line for the kicking team is the yard line through the most forward point from which the ball is kicked. (2) the fair-catch kick line for the receiving team is the yard line 10 yards in advance of the kicking team’s fair-catch kick line. note: though a fair-catch kick is not a free kick, the rules for a free-kick formation apply (6-1-3). however, the kicking team cannot possess the ball unless it has first been touched or possessed by the receivers. article 4. no tee. an artificial or manufactured tee shall not be permitted to assist in the execution of a field goal. article 5. foreign articles. no article of any type may be placed on the field, or used in any manner, to assist a player in the execution of a field goal and/or try attempt. article 6. ball next in play. after a field goal, the team scored upon will receive the kickoff. see 6-1-1-a. section 5 safety article 1. safety. it is a safety: (a) when the defense accepts a penalty for a foul committed by the offense in its own end zone (see also 14-2-2-b) or; (b) when an impetus by a team sends the ball behind its own goal line, and the ball is dead in the end zone in its possession or the ball is out of bounds behind the goal line. exceptions: it is not a safety: (1) if a forward pass from behind the line of scrimmage is incomplete in the end zone. (2) if a defensive player, in the field of play, intercepts a pass or catches or recovers a fumble, backward pass, scrimmage kick, free kick, or fair catch kick, and his original momentum carries him into his end zone where the ball is declared dead in his team’s possession. the ball belongs to the defensive team at the spot where the player’s foot or other body part touched the ground to establish possession. if that spot is in the end zone, the result of the play is a touchback, even if the ball is not on, above, or beyond the goal line. (11-6-1) (a) if a player of the team which intercepts, catches, or recovers the ball commits a live-ball foul in the end zone, it is a safety. (b) if a player who intercepts, catches, or recovers the ball throws a completed illegal forward pass from the end zone, the ball remains alive. if his opponent intercepts the illegal pass thrown from the end zone, the ball remains alive. if he scores, it is a touchdown. (c) if a player of the team which intercepts, catches, or recovers the ball commits a foul in the field of play, and the ball becomes dead in the end zone, the basic spot is the spot of the change of possession. (d) if the spot where possession changed is inside the one-yard line, the ball is to be spotted at the one-yard line. notes: (1) a ball in the end zone which is carried toward the field of play is still in the end zone until the entire ball is in the field of play (3-12-4). (2) the impetus is always attributed to the offense, unless the defense creates a new force that sends the ball behind its own goal line by muffing a ball which is at rest or nearly at rest, or by batting or kicking any loose ball (3-17). article 2. ball in play after safety. after a safety, the team scored upon must put the ball in play by a free kick (punt, dropkick, or placekick) from its 20-yard line. an artificial or manufactured tee cannot be used. see 6-1-1-b and 6-1-3. exception: for extension of either half, see 4-8-2-g. section 6 touchback note: a touchback, while not a score, is included in this rule because, like scoring plays, it is a case of a ball that is dead on or behind a goal line. article 1. definition. it is a touchback if the ball is dead on or behind the goal line a team is defending, provided that the impetus comes from an opponent, and that it is not a touchdown or an incomplete forward pass. note: a ball in the end zone which is carried toward the field of play is still in the end zone until the entire ball is in the field of play (3-12-4). article 2. touchback situations. when a team provides the impetus (3-17) that sends a loose ball behind its opponent’s goal line, it is a touchback: (a) if the ball is dead in the opponent’s possession in its end zone; (b) if the ball is out of bounds behind the goal line (see 8-7-3-item 4-a); 45rule 11 (c) if a scrimmage kick has not been touched by a player of the receiving team beyond the line of scrimmage, and the ball: (1) touches the ground on or behind the receiver’s goal line; (2) touches a player of the kicking team who is touching the ground on or behind the receiver’s goal line; or (3) touches a player of the kicking team who has touched the ground on or behind the receiver’s goal line and has not re-established himself in the field of play (see 11-4-2-b for exception for a missed field goal from beyond the 20-yard line). (d) if any legal or illegal kick touches the receivers’ goal posts, crossbar, or uprights, other than one which scores a field goal; (e) if the kickers interfere with the opportunity to catch an airborne kick or with a fair catch behind the receivers’ goal line (10-1 and 10-2); or (f) if a player of the kicking team illegally catches or recovers a scrimmage kick in the field of play, and carries the ball across the goal line, or touches the goal line with any part of his body while in possession of the ball. for exception for a missed field goal from beyond the 20-yard line, see 11-4-2-b. notes: (1) if the impetus is a scrimmage kick, and there has been a spot of first touching by the kickers beyond the receivers’ 20-yard line, the receivers shall have the option of taking possession of the ball at the spot of first touching. (2) the impetus is not from a kick if a muff, bat, juggle, or illegal kick of any kicked ball (by a player of either team) creates a new momentum which sends it on, above, or behind the goal line. see 3-17. article 3. ball next in play. after a touchback, the team that has been awarded the touchback next snaps the ball at its 20-yard line from any point on or between the inbound lines, unless the touchback results from a free kick, in which case the ball shall be placed at the team’s 25-yard line. 46rule 12 player conduct section 1 blocking, use of hands and arms article 1. legal and illegal block. a player of either team may block (obstruct or impede) an opponent at any time, provided that the act is not: (a) pass interference (see rule 8, section 5, article 1); (b) illegal contact (see rule 8, section 4); (c) fair catch interference or interference with the opportunity to catch a kick (see rule 10, section 1); (d) clipping against a non-runner (see section 2, article 1); (e) an illegal chop block (see section 2, article 5); (f) an illegal crackback block (see section 2, article 6); (g) an illegal low block during a free kick, a scrimmage kick, after a change of possession, or outside the tight end box (see section 2, article 4); (h) unnecessary roughness (see section 2, article 8); (i) roughing the passer (see section 2, article 11); (j) an illegal cut block (see rule 8, section 4, article 5); (k) roughing the kicker or holder (see section 2, articles 12 and 13); (l) offensive (see section 1, article 3(c)) or defensive (section 1, article 6) holding; (m) illegal use of hands (see section 1, article 3-a); (n) an illegal block in the back above the waist (see section 1, article 3-b); (o) tripping (see section 1, article 8); (p) an illegal peel back block (see section 2, article 2); or (q) an illegal blindside block (see section 2, article 7). penalty: for illegal use of hands, arms, or body by the offense: loss of 10 yards. article 2. legal block by offensive player. an offensive player is permitted to block an opponent by contacting him with his head, shoulders, hands, and/or outer surface of the forearm, or with any other part of his body that is not prohibited by another rule. a blocker may use his arms, or open or closed hands, to contact an opponent on or outside the opponent’s frame (the body of an opponent below the neck that is presented to the blocker), provided that he does not materially restrict him. the blocker must work immediately to bring his hands inside the opponent’s frame, and as the play develops, the blocker is permitted to work for and maintain his position against an opponent, provided that he does not illegally clip or illegally push from behind. an offensive player is permitted to use his hands or arms to restrict an opponent: (a) if he is a runner. a runner may ward off opponents with his hands and arms. he may also lay his hand on a teammate or push him into an opponent, but he may not grasp or hold on to a teammate. (b) during a loose ball that has touched the ground. an offensive player may use his hands/arms legally to block or otherwise push or pull an opponent out of the way in a personal attempt to recover the ball. see specific fumble, pass, or kick rules and especially 6-2-1. (c) a kicking team player. see 6-2-1 and 9-1-4 for blocking restrictions during a kick. article 3. illegal block by offensive player. it is a foul if an offensive blocker: (a) thrusts his hands forward above the frame of an opponent to forcibly contact him on the head, neck, or face; or note: contact in close-line play is not a foul, unless it is direct and forcible, or prolonged. penalty: for illegal use of hands by the offense: loss of 10 yards. (b) blocks an opponent (from behind) in the back above the opponent’s waist, or uses his hands or arms to push an opponent from behind in a manner that affects his movement, except in close-line play. note: the prohibition also applies to a player of the kicking team while the ball is in flight during a free kick or scrimmage kick. the use of hands on the back is not a foul when: (1) a player is making a personal attempt to recover a loose ball; (2) the opponent turns away from the blocker when contact is imminent; (3) both of the blocker’s hands are on the opponent’s side. (if either hand is on the back, it is a foul). penalty: for an illegal block in the back above the waist by the offense: loss of 10 yards. (c) uses his hands or arms to materially restrict or alter the defender’s path or angle of pursuit. it is a foul regardless of whether the blocker’s hands are inside or outside the frame of the defender’s body. material restrictions include but are not limited to: (1) grabbing or tackling an opponent; (2) hooking, jerking, twisting, or turning him; or (3) pulling him to the ground. penalty: for holding by the offense: loss of 10 yards. blocking notes: (1) when a defensive player is held by an offensive player during the following situations, offensive holding will not be called: (a) if the runner is being tackled simultaneously by any defensive player; (b) if the runner simultaneously goes out of bounds; (c) if a fair catch is made simultaneously; (d) if the action clearly occurs after a forward pass has been thrown to a receiver beyond the line of scrimmage; 47rule 12 (e) if the action occurs away from the point of attack and not within close-line play; (f) if a free kick results in a touchback; (g) if a scrimmage kick simultaneously becomes a touchback; (h) if the action is part of a double-team block, unless the defender splits the double team, gets to the outside of either blocker, or is taken to the ground; or (i) if, during a defensive charge, a defensive player uses a “rip” technique that puts an offensive player in a position that would normally be holding. exception: holding will be called if the defender’s feet are taken away from him by the blocker’s action. (2) if a blocker falls on or pushes down a defender whose momentum is carrying him to the ground, offensive holding will not be called unless the blocker prevents the defender from rising from the ground. (3) if the official has not seen the entire action that sends a defender to the ground, offensive holding will not be called. article 4. assisting the runner and interlocking interference. no offensive player may: (a) pull a runner in any direction at any time; (b) use interlocking interference, by grasping a teammate or by using his hands or arms to encircle the body of a teammate in an effort to block an opponent; or (c) push or throw his body against a teammate to aid him in an attempt to obstruct an opponent or to recover a loose ball. penalty: for assisting the runner, interlocking interference, or illegal use of hands, arms, or body by the offense: loss of 10 yards. article 5. legal use of hands or arms by defense. a defensive player may use his hands, arms, or body to push, pull, or ward off offensive players: (a) when he is defending himself against an obstructing opponent while attempting to reach the runner; (b) when an opponent is obviously attempting to block him; (c) in a personal attempt to reach a loose ball that has touched the ground during a backward pass, fumble, or kick; (d) during a forward pass that has crossed the neutral zone and has been touched by any player; and exceptions: (1) an eligible receiver is considered to be an obstructing opponent only to a point five yards beyond the line of scrimmage unless the player who receives the snap demonstrates no further intention to pass the ball. see 8-4-2, 8-4-3, and 8-4-7 for rules applicable to illegal contact with an eligible receiver. (2) see 8-4-5 for rules applicable for an illegal cut block against an eligible receiver. (e) during a kick. see 6-2-1 and 9-1-4 for blocking restrictions during a kick. article 6. defensive holding. it is a foul for defensive holding if: (a) a defensive player tackles or holds any opponent other than a runner, except as permitted in article 5. note: any offensive player who pretends to possess the ball, and/or one to whom a teammate pretends to give the ball, may be tackled until he crosses the line of scrimmage between the tackles of a normal tight offensive line. (b) during a punt, field goal attempt, or try-kick attempt, b1 grabs and pulls an offensive player out of the way, allowing b2 to shoot the gap (pull-and-shoot) in an attempt to block an apparent kick, except if b1 is advancing toward the kicker. penalty: for defensive holding: loss of five yards and an automatic first down. article 7. illegal use of hands by defense. it is a foul if a defensive player thrusts his hands or arms forward above the frame of an opponent to forcibly contact him on the neck, face, or head. note: contact in close-line play is not a foul, unless it is direct and forcible, or prolonged. penalty: for illegal use of hands by the defense: loss of five yards and an automatic first down. article 8. tripping. all players are prohibited from tripping an opponent, including the runner. penalty: for tripping by either team: loss of 10 yards. if the foul is by the defense, it is also an automatic first down. section 2 personal fouls article 1. clipping. there shall be no clipping against a non-runner. this does not apply to offensive blocking in close-line play where it is legal to clip above the knee(s), but it is illegal to clip at or below the knee(s). see 3-7, close-line play. exception: an offensive lineman may not clip a defender above the knees who, at the snap, is aligned on the line of scrimmage opposite another offensive lineman who is more than one position away, and the defender is responding to the flow of the ball away from the blocker. example: an offensive tackle cannot clip a defensive nose tackle on a sweep away. note: if there is a block from the side, or if an opponent turns his back as the block is being made, it is not clipping if the opponent is able to see or ward off the block, provided the blocker does not roll up on the back or side of the opponent’s leg(s). if an offensive player’s block (legal or illegal) is followed by the blocker rolling up on the back or side of the leg(s) of a defender, it is clipping, including in close-line play. when a blocker, who is moving in the same direction as an opponent, initially contacts the opponent on his side, and subsequently contacts the opponent below his waist from behind, it is not clipping if the contact is continuous. clipping shall not be called if an official has not observed the blocker’s initial contact with an opponent. 48rule 12 penalty: for illegal clipping: loss of 15 yards. article 2. “peel back” block. an offensive player cannot initiate contact on the side and below the waist against an opponent if: (a) the blocker is moving toward his own end line; and (b) he approaches the opponent from behind or from the side. note: if the near shoulder of the blocker completely crosses the front of both of his opponent’s legs, the block is legal. penalty: for a “peel back” block: loss of 15 yards. article 3. illegal cut block. see 8-4-5. article 4. blocking below the waist. blocks below the waist are prohibited in the following situations: (a) by players of either team after a change of possession; or (b) by players of the kicking team after a free kick, safety kick, fair-catch kick, punt, field-goal attempt, or try kick; (c) by players of the receiving team during a down in which there is a free kick, safety kick, fair-catch kick, punt, field- goal attempt, or try kick; or (d) by players of either team during a scrimmage down prior to a change of possession unless the contact occurs in the tight end box. (note: players are prohibited from initiating contact below the waist of an opponent outside the tight end box, except against a runner or a player who is attempting to catch a forward or backward pass). note: the following blocking restrictions may result in a foul even if they occur in the tight end box: (i) illegal cut block. see 8-4-5. (ii) clipping. see 12-2-1. (iii) “peel back” block. see 12-2-2. (iv) chop block. see 12-2-5. (v) crackback block. see 12-2-6. penalty: for illegally blocking below the waist: loss of 15 yards. article 5. chop block. all chop blocks are illegal. a chop block is a high/low double-team block by the offense in which one offensive player (designated as a1 for purposes of this rule) blocks a defensive player in the area of the thigh or lower while another offensive player (a2) engages that same defensive player above the waist. the order of the blocks is irrelevant. illegal chop blocks include, but are not limited to, the following situations: (a) a1 chops a defensive player while the defensive player is physically engaged above the waist by the blocking attempt of a2. (b) a2 physically engages a defensive player above the waist with a blocking attempt, and a1 chops the defensive player after the contact by a2 has been broken and while a2 is still confronting the defensive player. (c) a1 chops a defensive player while a2 confronts the defensive player in a pass-blocking posture but is not physically engaged with the defensive player (a “lure”). (d) a1 blocks a defensive player in the area of the thigh or lower, and a2, simultaneously or immediately after the block by a1, engages the defensive player high (“reverse chop”). (e) a1 is lined up in the backfield at the snap and subsequently chops a defensive player engaged above the waist by a2. (f) a1, an offensive lineman, chops a defensive player after the defensive player has been engaged by a2 (high or low). note: it is not a foul if the defender initiates the contact with the blocker, or if the blocker is trying to slip or escape from the defender, and any engagement with him is incidental. penalty: for chop block: loss of 15 yards. article 6. crackback block. all crackback blocks are illegal. item 1. definition. it is a crackback block if the following conditions are fulfilled: the block occurs within an area five yards on either side of the line of scrimmage, including within close-line play, by an offensive player who is moving toward the position from which the ball was snapped; and (a) the offensive player was in a set position and aligned more than two yards outside an offensive tackle (flexed) when the ball was snapped; or (b) the offensive player was in a backfield position when the ball was snapped and moved to a position more than two yards outside an offensive tackle; or (c) the offensive player was in a backfield position and in motion when the ball was snapped. item 2. prohibited contact. the following is prohibited against a player who is the recipient of a crackback block: (a) contacting him below the waist; (b) forcibly hitting his head or neck area with the helmet, facemask, forearm, or shoulder, even if the initial contact is lower than the player’s neck; (c) lowering the head and making forcible contact with any part of the helmet against any part of the defensive player’s body; or (d) illegally launching into him. it is an illegal launch if a player (i) leaves both feet prior to contact to spring forward and upward into his opponent, and (ii) uses any part of his helmet to initiate forcible contact against any part of his opponent’s body. (this does not apply to contact against a runner, unless the runner is still considered to be a defenseless player, as defined in article 9). 49rule 12 note: a player who initiates contact against such an opponent is responsible for avoiding an illegal act. a standard of strict liability applies for any contact against an opponent, even if his body position is in motion, and irrespective of any acts by him, such as ducking his head or curling up his body in anticipation of contact. penalty: for a crackback block: loss of 15 yards. article 7. blindside block. it is a foul if a player initiates a block when his path is toward or parallel to his own end line and makes forcible contact to his opponent with his helmet, forearm, or shoulder. note: it is not a foul for a blindside block if the forcible contact occurs in “close-line play” prior to the ball leaving that area. the ball is not considered to have left that area if the player who takes the snap, either from a shotgun position or from under center, retreats in the pocket immediately or with a slight delay, and hands the ball to another player, or runs with the ball himself. this exception does not apply to any action other than a designed play. any forcible contact in “close-line play” is still subject to the restrictions for crackback and peel back blocks. penalty: for a blindside block: loss of 15 yards. article 8. unnecessary roughness. there shall be no unnecessary roughness. this shall include, but will not be limited to: (a) using the foot or any part of the leg to strike an opponent with a whipping motion (leg whip); (b) forcibly contacting a runner when he is out of bounds; note: defensive players must make an effort to avoid contact. players on defense are responsible for knowing when a runner has crossed the boundary line, except in doubtful cases where he might step on a boundary line and continue parallel with it. (c) a player of the receiving team who has gone out of bounds and blocks a kicking team player out of bounds during the kick. if this occurs on a kick from scrimmage, post-possession rules will apply if appropriate (9-5-1); (d) running, diving into, or throwing the body against or on a runner whose forward progress has been stopped, who has slid, or who has declared himself down by going to the ground untouched and has made no attempt to advance (see 7-2-1-a-d); (e) running, diving into, or throwing the body against or on any player on the ground either before or after the ball is dead; (f) throwing the runner to the ground after the ball is dead; (g) unnecessarily running, diving into, cutting, or throwing the body against or on a player who (1) is out of the play or (2) should not have reasonably anticipated such contact by an opponent, before or after the ball is dead; (h) a kicker/punter, who is standing still or fading backward after the ball has been kicked, is out of the play and must not be unnecessarily contacted by the receiving team through the end of the down or until he assumes a distinctly defensive position. however, a kicker/punter is a defenseless player through the conclusion of the down (see 12-2-9-a-8); or (i) using any part of a player’s helmet or facemask to butt, spear, or ram an opponent (note: this provision does not prohibit incidental contact by the mask or the helmet in the course of a conventional tackle or block on an opponent). penalty: for unnecessary roughness: loss of 15 yards. the player may be disqualified if the action is judged by the official(s) to be flagrant. if the foul is by the defense, it is also an automatic first down. note: when in question about a roughness call or potentially dangerous tactics, the covering official(s) should always call unnecessary roughness. article 9. players in a defenseless posture. it is a foul if a player initiates unnecessary contact against a player who is in a defenseless posture. (a) players in a defenseless posture are: (1) a player in the act of or just after throwing a pass (passing posture). (2) a receiver running a pass route when the defender approaches from the side or behind. if the receiver becomes a blocker or assumes a blocking posture, he is no longer a defenseless player. (3) a player attempting to catch a pass who has not had time to clearly become a runner. if the player is capable of avoiding or warding off the impending contact of an opponent, he is no longer a defenseless player. (4) the intended receiver of a pass in the action during and immediately following an interception or potential interception. if the player is capable of avoiding or warding off the impending contact of an opponent, he is no longer a defenseless player. note: violations of this provision will be enforced after the interception, and the intercepting team will maintain possession. (5) a runner already in the grasp of a tackler and whose forward progress has been stopped. (6) a kickoff or punt returner attempting to field a kick in the air who has not had time to clearly become a runner. if the player is capable of avoiding or warding off the impending contact of an opponent, he is no longer a defenseless player (for enforcement, see 10-1-1 and ar 12.72). (7) a player on the ground. (8) a kicker/punter during the kick or during the return (also see article 8-h) for additional restrictions against a kicker/punter). (9) a quarterback at any time after a change of possession (also see article 11-e) for additional restrictions against a quarterback after a change of possession. (10) a player who receives a “blindside” block when the path of the blocker is toward or parallel to his own end line. (11) the offensive player who attempts a snap during a field goal attempt or a try kick. he is no longer a defenseless player after he has had an opportunity to defend himself or moves downfield. (b) prohibited contact against a player who is in a defenseless posture is: 50rule 12 (1) forcibly hitting the defenseless player’s head or neck area with the helmet, facemask, forearm, or shoulder, even if the initial contact is lower than the player’s neck, and regardless of whether the defensive player also uses his arms to tackle the defenseless player by encircling or grasping him; (2) lowering the head and making forcible contact with any part of the helmet against any part of the defenseless player’s body; or (3) illegally launching into a defenseless opponent. it is an illegal launch if a player (i) leaves both feet prior to contact to spring forward and upward into his opponent, and (ii) uses any part of his helmet to initiate forcible contact against any part of his opponent’s body. (this does not apply to contact against a runner, unless the runner is still considered to be a defenseless player, as defined in article 9). notes: (1) the provisions of (b) do not prohibit incidental contact by the mask or helmet in the course of a conventional tackle or block on an opponent. (2) a player who initiates contact against a defenseless opponent is responsible for avoiding an illegal act. this includes illegal contact that may occur during the process of attempting to dislodge the ball from an opponent. a standard of strict liability applies for any contact against a defenseless opponent, even if the opponent is an airborne player who is returning to the ground or whose body position is otherwise in motion, and irrespective of any acts by the defenseless opponent, such as ducking his head or curling up his body in anticipation of contact. penalty: for unnecessary roughness: loss of 15 yards and an automatic first down. the player may be disqualified if the action is judged by the official(s) to be flagrant. article 10. use of the helmet. it is a foul if a player lowers his head and makes forcible contact with his helmet against an opponent. penalty: loss of 15 yards. if the foul is by the defense, it is also an automatic first down. the player may be disqualified. article 11. roughing the passer. because the act of passing often puts the quarterback (or any other player attempting a pass) in a position where he is particularly vulnerable to injury, special rules against roughing the passer apply. the referee has principal responsibility for enforcing these rules. any physical acts against a player who is in a passing posture (i.e. before, during, or after a pass) which, in the referee’s judgment, are unwarranted by the circumstances of the play will be called as fouls. the referee will be guided by the following principles: (a) roughing will be called if, in the referee’s judgment, a pass rusher clearly should have known that the ball had already left the passer’s hand before contact was made; pass rushers are responsible for being aware of the position of the ball in passing situations; the referee will use the release of the ball from the passer’s hand as his guideline that the passer is now fully protected; once a pass has been released by a passer, a rushing defender may make direct contact with the passer only up through the rusher’s first step after such release (prior to second step hitting the ground); thereafter the rusher must be making an attempt to avoid contact and must not continue to “drive through” or otherwise forcibly contact the passer; incidental or inadvertent contact by a player who is easing up or being blocked into the passer will not be considered significant. (b) a rushing defender is prohibited from committing such intimidating and punishing acts as “stuffing” a passer into the ground or unnecessarily wrestling or driving him down after the passer has thrown the ball, even if the rusher makes his initial contact with the passer within the one-step limitation provided for in (a) above. when tackling a passer who is in a defenseless posture (e.g., during or just after throwing a pass), a defensive player must not unnecessarily or violently throw him down or land on top of him with all or most of the defender’s weight. instead, the defensive player must strive to fall to the side of the quarterback’s body, or to brace his fall with his arms to avoid landing on the quarterback with all or most of his body weight. (c) in covering the passer position, referees will be particularly alert to fouls in which defenders impermissibly use the helmet and/or facemask to hit the passer, or use hands, arms, or other parts of the body to hit the passer forcibly in the head or neck area (see also the other unnecessary roughness rules covering these subjects). a defensive player must not use his helmet against a passer who is in a defenseless posture—for example, (1) forcibly hitting the passer’s head or neck area with the helmet or facemask, even if the initial contact of the defender’s helmet or facemask is lower than the passer’s neck, and regardless of whether the defensive player also uses his arms to tackle the passer by encircling or grasping him; or (2) lowering the head and making forcible contact with any part of the helmet against any part of the passer’s body. this rule does not prohibit incidental contact by the mask or the helmet in the course of a conventional tackle on a passer. (d) a rushing defender is prohibited from forcibly hitting in the knee area or below a passer who has one or both feet on the ground, even if the initial contact is above the knee. it is not a foul if the defender is blocked (or fouled) into the passer and has no opportunity to avoid him. notes: (1) a defender cannot initiate a roll or lunge and forcibly hit the passer in the knee area or below, even if he is being contacted by another player. (2) it is not a foul if the defender swipes or grabs a passer in the knee area or below in an attempt to tackle him, provided he does not make forcible contact with the helmet, shoulder, chest, or forearm. (e) a passer who is standing still or fading backward after the ball has left his hand is obviously out of the play and must not be unnecessarily contacted by an opponent through the end of the down or until the passer becomes a blocker, or a runner, or, in the event of a change of possession during the down, until he assumes a distinctly defensive position. however, at any time after the change of possession, it is a foul if: (1) an opponent forcibly hits the quarterback’s head or neck area with his helmet, facemask, forearm, or shoulder (2) if an opponent lowers his head and makes forcible contact with any part of his helmet against any part of the passer’s body. this provision does not prohibit incidental contact by the mask or the helmet in the course of a conventional block. (f) when the passer goes outside the pocket area and either continues moving with the ball (without attempting to advance the ball as a runner) or throws while on the run, he loses the protection of the one-step rule provided for in (a) above, and the 51rule 12 protection against a low hit provided for in (d) above, but he remains covered by all the other special protections afforded to a passer in the pocket (b, c, and e), as well as the regular unnecessary roughness rules applicable to all player positions. if the passer stops behind the line and clearly establishes a passing posture, he will then be covered by all of the special protections for passers. (g) the referee must blow the play dead as soon as the passer is clearly in the grasp and control of any tackler behind the line, and the passer’s safety is in jeopardy. note: a player who initiates contact against a passer is responsible for avoiding an illegal act. this includes illegal contact that may occur during the process of attempting to dislodge the ball. a standard of strict liability applies for any contact against a passer, irrespective of any acts by the passer, such as ducking his head or curling up his body in anticipation of contact. penalty: for roughing the passer: loss of 15 yards and an automatic first down; disqualification, if flagrant. notes: (1) when in doubt about a roughness call or potentially dangerous tactic against the passer, the referee should always call roughing the passer. (2) see 8-6-1-exc.c–d for personal fouls prior to completion or interception. article 12. roughing/running into the kicker. no defensive player may run into or rough a kicker who kicks from behind the line unless such contact: (a) is incidental to and occurs after the defender has touched the kick in flight, or occurs simultaneously with the kicker kicking the ball; (b) is caused by the kicker’s own motions; (c) occurs during a quick kick or a rugby-style kick; (d) occurs during or after a run behind the line; (e) occurs after the kicker recovers a loose ball on the ground; (f) occurs because a defender is pushed or blocked (causing a change of direction) into the kicker; or (g) is the result of a foul by an opponent item 1. roughing the kicker. it is a foul for roughing the kicker if a defensive player: (a) contacts the plant leg of the kicker while his kicking leg is still in the air; or (b) slides into or contacts the kicker when both of the kicker’s feet are on the ground. it is not a foul if the contact is not severe, or if the kicker returns both feet to the ground prior to the contact and falls over a defender on the ground note: when in doubt, it is a foul for roughing the kicker. item 2. running into the kicker. it is a foul for running into the kicker if a defensive player: (a) contacts the kicking leg or foot of the kicker, even if the kicker is airborne when the contact occurs; or (b) slides under the kicker, preventing him from returning both feet to the ground penalties: (1) for roughing the kicker: loss of 15 yards from the previous spot (personal foul) and an automatic first down. the player may be disqualified if the action is flagrant. (2) for running into the kicker: loss of five yards from the previous spot (not a personal foul). there is not an automatic first down. article 13. roughing the holder. it is a foul for roughing the holder if a defensive player forcibly contacts the holder of a place kick, unless the contact: (a) is incidental and occurs after the defender has touched the kick in flight; (b) is caused because a defender is blocked into the holder; or (c) occurs after the holder recovers a ball that has touched the ground penalty: for roughing the holder: loss of 15 yards from the previous spot (personal foul) and an automatic first down. the player may be disqualified if the action is flagrant. notes: (1) any unnecessary roughness committed by defensive players is roughing the kicker or holder. the severity of the contact and the potential for injury are to be considered. (2) when two defensive players are making a bona fide attempt to block a kick from scrimmage (punt, drop kick, and/or placekick), and one of them runs into the kicker or holder after the ball has left the kicker’s foot at the same instant the second player blocks the kick, the foul for running into the kicker or holder shall not be enforced, unless in the judgment of the referee, the player running into the kicker or holder was clearly the direct cause of the kick being blocked. article 14. striking, kicking, or kneeing opponents. all players are prohibited from: (a) striking an opponent with his fists; (b) kicking or kneeing an opponent; (c) striking, swinging at, or clubbing the head, neck, or face of an opponent with the wrist(s), arm(s), elbow(s), or hand(s); or exceptions: contact to the head, neck, or face of an opponent with the palm of the hand is permitted: (1) by a defensive player who is attempting to ward off an offensive player at the line of scrimmage, provided that it is not a repeated act against the same opponent during any one contact; or (2) by any player in a personal attempt to recover a loose ball. (d) striking an opponent below the shoulders with his forearm or elbows by turning the trunk of his body at the waist, or by pivoting, or by any other way that is clearly unnecessary. 52rule 12 penalty: loss of 15 yards. if any of the fouls is judged by the official(s) to be flagrant, the offender may be disqualified as long as the entire action is observed by the official(s). if the foul is by the defense, it is also an automatic first down. article 15. twisting, pulling, or turning the facemask or helmet opening. no player shall grasp and control, twist, turn, push, or pull the facemask or helmet opening of an opponent in any direction. note: if a player grasps an opponent’s facemask or helmet opening, he must immediately release it. if he does not immediately release it and controls his opponent, it is a foul. penalty: for twisting, turning, pushing, pulling, or controlling the mask or helmet opening: loss of 15 yards. the player may be disqualified if the action is flagrant. if the foul is by the defense, it is also an automatic first down. article 16. horse-collar tackle. no player shall grab the inside collar of the back or the side of the shoulder pads or jersey, or grab the jersey at the name plate or above, and pull the runner toward the ground. this does not apply to a runner who is in the tackle box or to a quarterback who is in the pocket. note: it is not necessary for a player to pull the runner completely to the ground in order for the act to be illegal. if his knees are buckled by the action, it is a foul, even if the runner is not pulled completely to the ground. penalty: for a horse-collar tackle: loss of 15 yards and an automatic first down. article 17. use of helmet as a weapon. a player may not use a helmet that is no longer worn by anyone as a weapon to strike, swing at, or throw at an opponent. penalty: for illegal use of a helmet as a weapon: loss of 15 yards and automatic disqualification. if the foul is by the defense, it is also an automatic first down. article 18. other personal fouls. fouls that include a 15-yard penalty, but are not listed in this section or in section 3, are considered personal fouls for penalty enforcement purposes. section 3 unsportsmanlike conduct article 1. prohibited acts. there shall be no unsportsmanlike conduct. this applies to any act which is contrary to the generally understood principles of sportsmanship. such acts specifically include, among others: (a) throwing a punch, or a forearm, or kicking at an opponent, even though no contact is made.

(g) using any object as a prop, or possessing any foreign or extraneous object(s) that are not part of the uniform on the field or the sideline during the game, other than the football after a scoring play or change of possession. if any foreign object(s) are deemed a safety hazard by the game officials, in addition to a yardage penalty, the player will be subject to ejection from the game, whether he uses the object or not. note: violations of (a), (b), (c), (d), and (e) will be penalized if they occur anywhere in the stadium in which the officials have jurisdiction. (h) removal of his helmet by a player in the field of play or the end zone during a celebration or demonstration, or during a confrontation with a game official or any other player. notes: (1) two violations of (a), (b), or (c) (above) by the same player, which occur before or during the game, will result in disqualification in addition to the yardage penalty. any violations at the game site on the day of the game, including postgame, may result in discipline by the commissioner. any violation of (e) above may result in disqualification and also will include discipline by the commissioner. an official must see the entire action for a player to be disqualified. (2) violations of (f) and (g) will be penalized if they occur anywhere on the field other than the bench area. penalty: (for (a) through (h)): loss of 15 yards from the succeeding spot or whatever spot the referee, after consulting with the crew, deems equitable. if the foul is by the defense, it is also an automatic first down.

(c) using baiting or taunting acts or words that may engender ill will between teams. the player will be automatically disqualified regardless of whether the penalty is accepted or declined by the opponent. the fouls do not have to be judged by the official to be flagrant for the automatic disqualification to occur, and any foul that occurs during the pregame warm-up period will carry over into the game. nothing in this section supersedes the game official’s discretion to judge a foul to be flagrant and disqualify the player based on one occurrence. note: this rule also applies to non-player personnel (e.g., management personnel, coaches, trainers, equipment personnel). section 5 illegal bats and kicks article 1. illegal bat. it is an illegal bat if: (a) any player bats or punches a loose ball in the field of play toward his opponent’s goal line (b) any player bats or punches a loose ball (that has touched the ground) in any direction, if it is in either end zone (c) an offensive player bats a backward pass in flight toward his opponent’s goal line exception: a forward pass in flight may be tipped, batted, or deflected in any direction by any eligible player at any time. note: if a forward pass that is controlled by a player prior to completing the catch is thrown forward, it is an illegal bat. if it is caught by a teammate or intercepted by an opponent, the ball remains alive. if it is not caught, the ball is dead when it hits the ground. 54rule 12 penalty: for illegal batting or punching the ball: loss of 10 yards. if the foul is by team a before possession changes during a scrimmage down: loss of down and loss of 10 yards except for a foul by team a beyond the line of scrimmage during a scrimmage kick, in which case there is no loss of down. article 2. illegally kicking ball. no player may deliberately kick a loose ball or a ball that is in a player’s possession. penalty: for illegally kicking the ball: loss of 10 yards. if the foul is by team a before possession changes during a scrimmage down: loss of down and loss of 10 yards except for a foul by team a beyond the line of scrimmage during a scrimmage kick, in which case there is no loss of down. notes: (1) if a loose ball is unintentionally touched by any part of a player’s leg (including the knee), it is not considered kicking and is treated as touching. (2) if the penalty for an illegal bat or kick is declined, the procedure is the same as though the ball had been muffed. however, if the act (impetus) sends the ball behind a goal line, 3-17 applies. (3) the penalty for articles 1 and 3 does not preclude a penalty for a palpably unfair act. see palpably unfair act (12-3-4). (4) the ball is not dead when an illegally kicked ball is recovered, unless another rule prescribes otherwise. 55rule 13 non-player conduct section 1 non-player conduct article 1. non-player fouls. there shall be no unsportsmanlike conduct by a substitute, coach, attendant, or any other non-player (entitled to sit on a team’s bench) during any period or timeout (including between halves). notes: (1) “loud speaker” coaching from the sidelines is not permissible.

(3) it is impermissible for the grounds crew or other team personnel to clear away snow for a try kick, field goal, punt, or kickoff. article 2. team attendants may enter field during timeout. either or both team attendants and their helpers may enter the field to attend to their team during a team timeout by either team. no other non-player may come on the field without the referee’s permission, unless he is an incoming substitute (5-2-2). during any team timeout, all playing rules continue in force. representatives of either team are prohibited from entering the field unless they are incoming substitutes, or team attendants or trainers entering to provide for the welfare of a player, and any game-type activities are prohibited on the field. the head coach may enter the field to check on the welfare of a player who is injured, but no assistant coach may enter the field. article 3. bench credentials. with the exception of uniformed players eligible to participate in the game, all persons in a team’s bench area must wear a visible credential clearly marked “bench.” for all nfl games—pre-season, regular season, and post-season the home club will be issued a maximum of 27 credentials and the visiting club will be issued a maximum of 25 credentials for use in its bench area. such credentials must be worn by coaches, players under contract to the applicable club but ineligible to participate in the game, and team support personnel (trainers, doctors, equipment men). from time to time, persons with game services credentials (e.g., oxygen technicians, ball boys/girls) and authorized club personnel not regularly assigned to the bench area may be in a team’s bench area for a brief period without bench credentials. clubs are prohibited from allowing into their bench areas any persons who are not officially affiliated with the club or otherwise serving a necessary game day function. article 4. restricted areas. all team personnel must observe the zone restrictions applicable to the bench area and the border rimming the playing field. the only persons permitted within the solid six-foot white border (1-1-2) while play is in progress on the field are game officials. for reasons involving the safety of participating players whose actions may carry them out of bounds, officials’ unobstructed coverage of the game, and spectators’ sightlines to the field, the border rules must be observed by all coaches and players in the bench area. violators are subject to penalty by the officials. article 5. movement on sidelines. coaches and other non-participating team personnel (including uniformed players not in the game at the time) are prohibited from moving laterally along the sidelines any further than the points that are 18 yards from the middle of the bench area (i.e., 25-yard lines to left and right of bench areas when benches are placed on opposite sides of the field). lateral movement within the bench area must be behind the solid six-foot white border. exception: when the ball is positioned near a goal line, a head coach may move laterally down the sideline outside the bench area to call a team timeout or challenge an on-field ruling. article 6. non-bench areas. clubs are prohibited from allowing into the non-bench areas of field level any persons who have not been accredited to those locations by the home club’s public relations office for purposes related to news media coverage, stadium operations, or pregame and halftime entertainment. the home club is responsible for keeping the field level cleared of all unauthorized persons. photographers and other personnel accredited for field-level work must not be permitted in the end zones or any other part of the official playing field while play is in progress. penalty: for illegal acts under articles 1 through 6 above: loss of 15 yards from team for whose supposed benefit foul was made. (unsportsmanlike conduct). enforcement is from: (a) the succeeding spot if the ball is dead. (b) whatever spot the referee, after consulting with the crew, deems equitable, if the ball was in play. for a flagrant violation, the referee may exclude the offender(s) from the playing field enclosure for the remainder of the game. article 7. palpably unfair act (non-player). a non-player shall not commit any act which is palpably unfair. penalty: for a palpably unfair act, see 12-3-4. the referee, after consulting with the crew, shall make such ruling as he/she considers equitable (19-1-3).

(2) if there is a personal foul that is also defensive pass interference, both fouls may be enforced. 58rule 14 section 2 special enforcement for penalties article 1. half-distance penalty. if the enforcement of a distance penalty would move the ball more than half the distance from the spot of enforcement to the offender’s goal line, the penalty shall be half the distance from the spot of enforcement to its goal line. this general rule supersedes any other general or specific enforcement of a distance penalty. exceptions: (1) see rule 8-2-1 for enforcement for intentional grounding. (2) see rule 12-3-4 for enforcement for a palpably unfair act. article 2. foul behind a goal line.

(b) the spot of the foul: the spot at which a foul was committed or, by rule, is considered to have been committed. (c) the spot of a backward pass or a fumble: the spot at which the backward pass or fumble occurred during the down in which there was a foul. (d) the dead ball spot: the spot at which the ball became dead. (e) the succeeding spot: the spot at which the ball will next be put in play (i.e., the spot of the ball after enforcement for a foul, or, if there has been no foul, the spot at which the ball became dead). (f) the spot of a change of possession: the spot at which possession is gained by or awarded to the opponent. article 5. basic spot. the basic spot is a reference point that is used to determine the spot of enforcement for fouls committed pursuant to the three-and-one method of enforcement. it is applicable for fouls committed during (i) a running play or (ii) a backward pass or fumble. (a) for fouls committed during a running play which is not followed by a change of possession, the basic spot is the dead-ball spot. (b) for fouls committed during a running play which is followed by a change of possession, the basic spot is the spot where possession is lost. (c) for fouls committed during a backward pass or fumble, the basic spot is the spot of the backward pass or the spot of the fumble. article 6. three-and-one method of enforcement. for fouls committed during a run, a backward pass, or a fumble, the penalty is enforced from the basic spot if: (a) the defense fouls in advance of the basic spot; (b) the defense fouls behind the basic spot; or (c) the offense fouls in advance of the basic spot. if the offense fouls behind the basic spot, enforcement is from the spot of the foul (three-and-one method of enforcement). exceptions for fouls committed by the offense: (1) fouls committed by the offense behind the line of scrimmage, except for fouls committed in the end zone, are enforced from the previous spot. see rule 8-2-1 for enforcement for intentional grounding. 59rule 14 (2) if the offense commits a foul in its end zone that is accepted, it is a safety. (3) if the offense commits a foul beyond the line of scrimmage and the basic spot is behind the line of scrimmage, enforcement is from the previous spot. if the dead-ball spot is in the offensive end zone, it is a safety, regardless of where the foul occurs. (4) if the offense commits a foul in the defense’s end zone prior to scoring a touchdown, enforcement is from the goal line. exception for fouls committed by the defense: (1) when the basic spot is behind the line of scrimmage, and the defense has committed a foul either behind or beyond the line of scrimmage, the penalty is enforced from the previous spot. section 4 spots of enforcement article 1. foul before or at the snap. item 1. before the snap. a foul that occurs prior to the snap is enforced from the succeeding spot, and the down remains the same, unless enforcement of the foul results in a first down. item 2. at the snap. a foul that occurs at the snap is enforced from the previous spot, and the down is repeated, unless enforcement of the foul results in a first down. article 2. foul committed during running play. for a foul committed during a running play when there is not a subsequent change of possession during the down, the basic spot is the dead-ball spot. the three-and-one method of enforcement is used (see section 3, article 6). note: a foul during a run prior to a forward pass or kick from behind the line is enforced as a foul during a passing play or during a scrimmage kick. article 3. foul committed during running play before change of possession. when a foul occurs during a running play, and the run in which the foul occurs is followed by a change of possession, the basic spot is the spot where possession is lost. the three-and-one method of enforcement is used (see section 3, article 6). notes: (1) if the foul is by the defensive team, the ball reverts to the offensive team prior to enforcement of the foul. (2) if the foul is by the offensive team, the defense must decline the penalty to retain possession. however, if the foul by the offense was a personal foul or unsportsmanlike conduct foul, the defense retains possession, and enforcement is from the dead-ball spot. if the defense subsequently loses possession, the penalty is enforced from the spot where possession changed, and the defense retains possession. (3) if there are multiple fouls by the defense, the enforcement shall be that which is most beneficial to the offense. article 4. foul committed after change of possession (end zone enforcement). if there is a foul by either team after a change of possession, and the dead-ball spot is in team b’s end zone, enforcement shall be as follows: (a) fouls by team a: (1) if the impetus that sent the ball in touch was provided by team b, enforcement is from the goal line. see note below for exception when a player’s momentum carries him into the end zone. (2) if the impetus that sent the ball in touch was provided by team a, enforcement is from the 20-yard line, or from the 25-yard line if the impetus was from a free kick. (b) fouls by team b (team a impetus): (1) if team b attempts to advance the ball, and the spot of its foul is in the end zone, the result is a safety. (2) if team b does not attempt to advance the ball, and its foul occurs in the end zone, enforcement is from the 20-yard line, or from the 25-yard line if the impetus was from a free kick. (3) if the spot of its foul is in the field of play, the penalty is enforced from either the spot of the foul or the touchback spot (20 or 25), whichever is least beneficial to team b, regardless of whether team b attempts to advance the ball. note: if a team b player’s original momentum carries him into his end zone, where the ball is declared dead in his team’s possession, the dead-ball spot is considered to be the spot at which the player established possession. see 11-5-1-exc. 2. (c) fouls by team b (team b impetus): (1) regardless of whether the foul is in the field of play or in the end zone, the result is a safety. note: dead-ball fouls by either team are enforced from the succeeding spot. article 5. foul committed during passing play. if there is a foul by either team from the time of the snap until a forward pass thrown from behind the line ends, the penalty is enforced from the previous spot. a pass play ends and a running play begins at the instant that a pass is caught. exceptions: (1) intentional grounding is a loss of down at the spot of the foul, or a loss of down and a 10-yard penalty from the previous spot, whichever is less beneficial for the offense. if the foul occurs less than 10 yards behind the line of scrimmage, but more than half the distance to the goal line, the ball shall be placed at the spot of the pass. (if the pass is thrown from the end zone, it is a safety). (2) pass interference by the defense is enforced at the spot of the foul. if it occurs in the fouling team’s end zone, the ball will be placed at the one-yard line, or half the distance to the goal line from the previous spot, whichever is more beneficial to the offense. (3) it is a safety when the offensive team commits a foul behind its own goal line. 60rule 14 (4) if there is a personal foul or unsportsmanlike conduct foul by the defense prior to the completion of a forward pass thrown from behind the line, enforcement is from the previous spot or the dead-ball spot, whichever is more beneficial to the offense. if the passing team is fouled and subsequently loses possession after a completion, the passing team retains possession of the ball, and enforcement is from the previous spot. (5) if there is a personal foul or unsportsmanlike conduct foul by the offense prior to the offense losing possession during a pass play or a subsequent running play, enforcement is from the dead-ball spot. however, if the defense subsequently loses possession, the penalty is enforced from the spot of the defense's catch or recovery, and the defense retains possession. this also applies to a personal foul or unsportsmanlike conduct foul by the offense prior to a forward pass thrown from behind the line when the offense fails to make the line to gain. notes: (1) the penalty for a forward pass from behind the line after the ball has been beyond the line, or for a second forward pass from behind the line, is enforced from the previous spot, unless the spot of the pass is behind the passer’s goal line, in which case it is a safety. (2) if a forward pass is thrown from beyond the line of scrimmage, or when there is no line of scrimmage, it is a foul during a running play. article 6. foul during a backward pass or fumble. if there is a foul by either team during a backward pass or fumble, the basic spot is the spot of the backward pass or fumble. the three-and-one method of enforcement is used (see section 3, article 6). notes: (1) if team b gains possession in its end zone, and the impetus was provided by team a, if team b fumbles or throws a backward pass in the end zone and fouls while the ball is loose, the spot of the fumble or the backward pass is considered to be the b20-yard line, or the 25-yard line if the impetus was from a free kick. (2) if a team b player’s original momentum carries him into his end zone, where he fumbles the ball, the spot of the fumble is considered to be the spot at which the player established possession. see 11-5-1-exc. 2. (3) if there is a personal foul or unsportsmanlike conduct foul by the offense during a fumble or backward pass that is recovered by the defense, enforcement is from the dead-ball spot. if the recovering team subsequently loses possession, the penalty is enforced from the spot of its recovery, and it retains possession. this also applies to a personal foul or unsportsmanlike conduct foul by the offense during a fumble or backward pass that is recovered by the offense, and the offense fails to make the line to gain. article 7. foul during free kick play. if there is a foul during a free kick, enforcement is from the previous spot, and the free kick is made again. however, if the kicking team commits a foul prior to the end of the kick, and the receiving team retains possession throughout the down, it will have the option of enforcing the penalty at the previous spot and replaying the down or adding the penalty yardage to the dead-ball spot. exceptions: (1) a personal foul (blocking) after a fair-catch signal is enforced from the spot of the foul. (2) a foul for fair-catch interference is enforced from the spot of the foul. (3) a foul for interference with the opportunity to make a catch is enforced from the spot of the foul. (4) a foul for an invalid fair catch signal is enforced from the spot of the foul.

(8) double fouls are enforced according to customary rules. notes: (1) the dead-ball spot for free kicks that result in a touchback is the 25-yard line. (2) in (1), (2), (3), and (5) above, if the foul is not part of a double foul and the opponent has possession at the end of the down, the foul may be enforced from the dead-ball spot. see 14-2-4. a free kick ends when team b establishes possession. fouls by team a prior to the time that team b establishes possession are offensive fouls. if team a legally recovers a free kick, there is no change of possession. after team b establishes possession, a running play begins, and fouls that occur thereafter are enforced from the dead-ball spot or the spot of the foul (three-and-one method). article 8. foul during scrimmage kick play. if there is a foul from the time of the snap until a legal scrimmage kick ends, enforcement is from the previous spot. this includes a foul during a run prior to a legal kick, and a foul by the kicking team during a missed field-goal attempt. exceptions: (1) if the offensive team commits a foul in its own end zone, it is a safety. (2) unless the kick is a missed field-goal attempt, if there is a foul by the kicking team, the receiving team will have the option of taking the penalty at the previous spot and replaying the down, or adding the penalty yardage on to the dead-ball spot. notes: (a) the dead-ball spot for scrimmage kicks that result in a touchback is the 20-yard line. (b) if there is a foul for an illegal touch inside the five-yard line, the receiving team also has the option of accepting a touchback. (c) if there is a personal foul or unsportsmanlike conduct foul by the kicking team during a missed field-goal attempt where the receiving team is awarded the ball (see 11-4-2), enforcement is from the succeeding spot. 61rule 14 (3) fair-catch interference, interference with the opportunity to make a catch, an invalid fair-catch signal, or a personal foul (blocking) after a fair-catch signal are enforced from the spot of the foul. note: if the foul is not part of a double foul and the opponent has possession at the end of the down, the foul may be enforced from the dead-ball spot. see 14-2-4. (4) except for fouls that are committed in an attempt to block the kick (such as running into or roughing the kicker, defensive holding (pull-and-shoot), leverage, leaping, and pushing teammate(s) into the offensive formation), if the receiving team commits a foul after the kick crosses the line of scrimmage, the penalty for its infraction will be enforced as if it had been in possession of the ball at the time the foul occurred (a post-possession foul), provided that the receiving team does not lose possession of the ball at any time during the down. the penalty shall be enforced from whichever of the following spots is least beneficial to the receiving team: (a) the end of the kick; or (b) the spot of the foul. if the foul occurs in the end zone, it is deemed to have occurred at the 20-yard line, unless enforcement results in a safety (14-4-4). (5) for enforcement of a personal or unsportsmanlike conduct foul on a play that results in a score, see 14-2-3; for illegally kicking a loose ball, see 12-5-2; and for an illegal bat, see 12-5-1. when team b establishes possession of the ball, a scrimmage kick ends, and a running play begins, and fouls that occur thereafter are enforced from the dead-ball spot or the spot of the foul (three-and-one method, 14-3-6). article 9. dead ball foul and foul between downs. a dead ball foul is a foul that occurs in the continuing action after a down ends, or a taunting foul that occurs at any time. the penalty for a dead ball foul is enforced from the succeeding spot, and the down counts. a foul between downs is a foul that occurs after the end of the down and after any continuing action resulting from the down, but prior to the next snap or free kick. the penalty for a foul between downs is enforced from the succeeding spot, and the down counts, but it cannot be combined with a live ball foul or a dead ball foul to create a multiple or double foul. a foul between downs is always enforced separately from any other foul. a foul against an official, regardless of when it occurs, is always treated as a foul between downs. see 12-3-1-e-pen. exception: if there is a personal, unsportsmanlike conduct, or taunting foul by either team following the end of the second or fourth periods, the penalty yardage will be enforced on the second-half kickoff or the kickoff in overtime, unless it is part of a double foul (see section 5). item 1. dead ball foul by team a. if there is a dead ball foul by team a after a down in which team a has made a first down, after enforcement of the penalty it will be first-and-10 for team a. if there is a foul between downs after a down in which team a has made a first down, after enforcement of the penalty it will be first-and-25 for team a. item 2. dead ball fouls by both teams. dead ball fouls by both teams are offset at the succeeding spot, and the down counts, but any disqualified player or players must be removed pursuant to rule 5, section 2, article 7. item 3. live ball and dead ball fouls. live ball fouls and dead ball fouls combine to create double fouls or multiple fouls, and all customary rules for enforcement apply. exceptions: (1) if there is a 5-yard vs. 15-yard double foul on the last play of a half, and the 15-yard penalty is for a dead ball foul (personal, unsportsmanlike conduct, or taunting) by either team, the penalty yardage will be enforced on the second half kickoff or the kickoff to start overtime. there will be no extension of the period. (2) if the scoring team commits a dead ball foul after a score, and its opponent’s live ball foul is not for unsportsmanlike conduct or unnecessary roughness, the opponent’s foul is disregarded, the score counts, and the offensive team’s dead-ball foul is enforced on the succeeding kickoff or try. if the opponent’s foul is for unsportsmanlike conduct or unnecessary roughness, the score counts, and the fouls offset on the kickoff. notes: (1) when a foul occurs simultaneously with the ball becoming dead, it is considered to be a dead ball foul. (2) the succeeding spot for a foul that occurs after a touchdown and before a whistle for a try is the next kickoff. (3) the time between downs includes the interval during all timeouts (including intermissions). see 3-37-1. section 5 fouls by both teams (double fouls) article 1. double foul without change of possession. if there is a double foul (3-14-1-e) during a down in which there is not a change of possession, the penalties are offset, and the down is replayed at the previous spot. if it is a scrimmage down, the number of the next down and the line to gain is the same as for the down in which the fouls occurred. exceptions: (1) if one or more fouls by one team includes a 15-yard penalty, and the penalty for the foul or fouls committed by the other team is for a five-yard penalty without an automatic first down, a loss of down, or a 10-second runoff (15 yards versus five yards), or that is not a spot foul, the 15-yard penalty is enforced from the previous spot, and the five-yard penalty is disregarded. five vs. 15 enforcement cannot be declined by the team that committed the minor foul, except as described in (2) below. see 4-8-2-h and 14-4-9-item 3-exc. 1 for dead ball fouls at the end of a half. 62rule 14 (2) if one of the fouls is a dead ball foul for delay of game for spiking the ball and the opponent’s foul is a live ball foul, the team that committed the delay of game foul, in addition to article 1 above, will have the option to decline the foul committed by its opponent and be assessed the penalty for delay from the dead-ball spot. (3) if both fouls are dead ball fouls or are treated as such (14-4-9), the penalties are offset, and the ball is next put in play at the succeeding spot, unless the dead ball fouls occur after the ball has been made ready for play, in which case 5 vs. 15 enforcement applies. note: disqualification of one or more players is enforced, even though the penalties are offset. article 2. double foul with a change of possession. if there is a double foul during a down in which there is a change or changes of possession, including if one of the fouls is a post-possession foul by team b during a scrimmage kick, the team last gaining possession will keep the ball after enforcement for its foul, provided it did not foul prior to last gaining possession (“clean hands”). exceptions: (1) if team a fouls during a kickoff, punt, safety kick, fair-catch kick, or field-goal attempt prior to the change of possession, team b may elect to replay the down at the previous spot. (2) if a safety results from the enforcement of a foul by team b, the down is replayed at the previous spot. (3) if both teams foul after the last change of possession (double foul after change of possession), the penatlies are offset, and the team last in possession shall retain the ball at the spot where its foul would be enforced if it was the only foul. if the spot is normally a touchback, the ball is placed on the 20-yard line, or the 25-yard line if the impetus was from a free kick. if it is normally a safety, the ball is placed on the one-yard line. on kicking plays, if team a also fouled prior to the change of possession, team b shall also have the option in (1) above. if the team last in possession does not have “clean hands” when it establishes possession, the penalties offset, and the down is replayed at the previous spot. 63rule 15 instant replay section 1 initiating a replay review article 1. coach challenges. each team is permitted two challenges that will initiate instant replay reviews: (a) the head coach can initiate a challenge by throwing a red flag onto the field of play before the next legal snap or kick.

(c) the head coach may challenge on-field rulings listed in section 3, except for those plays that only the replay official can challenge (article 2). (d) each challenge requires an available team timeout. a team that is out of timeouts, or has used all its available challenges, may not attempt to initiate a challenge. a team that initiates a challenge when the team is not permitted to challenge will be charged a team timeout. penalty: for initiating a challenge when a team has exhausted its timeouts: loss of 15 yards enforced as a foul between downs.

(2) incomplete changed to catch and fumble. when a ruling of incomplete is changed to a catch and fumble, the ball will be awarded at the spot of recovery to the team that recovers the ball in the immediate continuing action. if there is no clear recovery, the ball will be awarded to the team last in possession at the spot where possession was lost. item 2. recovery of a loose ball. whether a player legally recovered a loose ball in the field of play, at the sideline, goal line, or in the end zone. item 3. forward pass or fumble. whether a passer’s hand started forward with control of the ball, or whether the ball was fumbled. notes: (1) when an on-field ruling is incomplete, and the passer clearly fumbled the ball, the ball will be awarded at the spot of recovery to the team that recovers the ball in the immediate continuing action. if there is no clear recovery, the ball will be awarded to the team last in possession at the spot where possession was lost, except that if possession was lost in the team’s own end zone, and the ball was not clearly recovered in the end zone, the ball will be placed at the one-yard line. (2) when a ruling of fumble is changed to an incomplete forward pass, a foul for intentional grounding can be created in replay only if a pre-review announcement was made that a changed ruling would create the foul. (3) this item applies to a ruling that a passer muffed a snap or spiked the ball to stop a running clock. item 4. fumble. whether a runner lost possession before he was down by contact, or had given himself up. notes: (1) when an on-field ruling is down by contact, and the runner clearly fumbled the ball, the ball will be awarded at the spot of recovery to the team that recovers the ball in the immediate continuing action. if there is no clear recovery, the ruling on the field stands. (2) the spot of a forward fumble out of bounds, or a fumble that occurs on fourth down, or after the two-minute warning, or during a try, is reviewable regardless of whether on-field officials return the ball to the spot of the fumble, and regardless of whether it involves a score, potential score, a change of possession, or the line to gain. article 3. plays involving touching of either the ball or the ground. item 1. down by contact. whether a player was down by contact while in possession of the ball. item 2. touching of a forward pass. whether a player touched a forward pass. notes: (1) only the fact of touching, and not intent, is reviewable. (2) a player touching a pass will remove a foul for offensive or defensive pass interference if the touching occurs away from and noticeably before the interference. item 3. touching of a kick. whether a player touched a kick and the spot of touching. note: a foul for running into or roughing the kicker or holder can be removed if the kicked ball was touched before the contact. if a pre-review announcement was made that there was no foul because the ball was ruled to be touched, a foul for running into or roughing the kicker or holder can be created in replay if the ball was not touched before the contact. item 4. touching of a loose ball. whether a player touched a loose ball. item 5. ball touching the ground on a free kick. whether a ball hit the ground after being kicked. item 6. ball touching the ground on a scrimmage kick. whether a ball touched the ground before being caught or recovered by a punter or holder. article 4. plays governed by the goal line. item 1. ball breaking the plane of the goal line. whether any part of the ball broke the plane of the goal line while in player possession and before the ball should have been declared dead. notes: (1) a ruling of a touchdown can be reviewed to determine if the runner fumbled before the ball broke the plane of the goal line. if there is no clear recovery in the immediate continuing action, the team that fumbled is awarded the ball at the spot of the fumble. (2) the dead-ball spot is not reviewable to determine solely whether it should be closer to or further from the goal line. item 2. momentum. whether a player’s momentum spot was in the field of play or in the end zone (rule 11-5-1-b, exc. 2). a ruling of whether a player’s momentum caused him to enter his end zone is not reviewable. 65rule 15 note: for purposes of a replay review, the momentum spot is the spot where the second foot (or other body part other than the hands) touched the ground. if that spot is on the goal line or in the end zone, it is a touchback. article 5. plays governed by the boundary lines. item 1. runner inbounds. a ruling that a runner was out of bounds is reviewable only to determine: (a) the spot of the ball in relation to the line to gain or the goal line at the spot where the runner was ruled to have touched out of bounds; (b) if the runner fumbled the ball before taking two additional steps beyond the spot where he was ruled out of bounds; or (c) if the ball broke the plane of the goal line in the runner’s possession before taking two additional steps beyond the spot where he was ruled out of bounds. item 2. receiver out of bounds. whether a receiver touched out of bounds is reviewable to determine whether he was eligible to touch the ball and whether a defender could legally contact him. item 3. passer out of bounds before throwing pass. a ruling that a player stepped out of bounds before throwing a pass is not reviewable to determine if he was inbounds when he threw the pass. item 4. player out of bounds on scrimmage kick. whether a player was out of bounds during a scrimmage kick is reviewable to determine the spot of the ball and whether the ball was illegally touched. item 5. loose ball. whether a loose ball touched a boundary line, anything on the boundary line, a pylon, or an object. note: ball that does not touch a boundary line. if an on-field ruling that a loose ball touched a boundary line is changed, possession can be awarded to a team that recovers the loose ball in the immediate continuing action. article 6. plays governed by the line of scrimmage. item 1. illegal passes. whether a forward pass was thrown when the passer was beyond the line of scrimmage, or after the ball had crossed the line of scrimmage and returned behind it. rule 8-1-2, item 1. item 2. illegal kick. whether a scrimmage kick was from beyond the line of scrimmage, or a second kick was made after the ball had crossed the line of scrimmage. rule 9-1-1. article 7. plays governed by the line to gain. the dead-ball spot is reviewable to determine whether it was short of, at, or beyond the line to gain. notes: (1) for purposes of a replay review, forward progress is determined when a player with control of the ball is contacted by an opponent and driven backwards. (2) a challenge is successful only if the ruling of whether a new series was awarded is changed, regardless of whether the ball was moved closer to the line to gain. (3) following review, the ball will be placed at the correct dead-ball spot, but the challenge will be successful only if the line to gain ruling is changed. article 8. number of players on the field. whether a player is on the field at the snap or when officials rule a dead-ball foul for too many players in formation. for a player to be off the field, he must touch the ground out of bounds. for a player to be on the field, both feet or a body part must touch the ground in the field of play. article 9. game administration and consultation. the replay official and designated members of the officiating department may consult with on-field officials, or conduct a replay review, or advise the game officials on specific, objective aspects of a play when clear and obvious video evidence is present, and/or to address game administration issues, including, but not limited to: (a) penalty enforcement; (b) the proper down; (c) spot of a foul; (d) the game clock; (e) possession; (f) completed or intercepted pass; (g) touching of a loose ball, boundary line, goal line, or end line; (h) location of the football or a player in relation to a boundary line, the line of scrimmage, the line to gain, or the goal line; or (i) down by contact (when a player is not ruled down by contact on the field). nothing in this article precludes a head coach or replay official from initiating a challenge or review otherwise allowed under rule 15, section 1. item 1. game clock. the game clock is reviewable for purposes of restoring time to the clock but not for purposes of taking time off the clock. notes: (1) time can be restored to the game clock if the clock operator incorrectly starts the game clock when it should remain stopped, provided that the correction occurs before the next legal snap or kick. (2) an on-field ruling that time expired during or after the last play of any half, or of an overtime period in the preseason or regular season, or of an overtime half in the postseason, is reviewable by the replay official only when the visual evidence demonstrates that the clock should have stopped with two or more seconds remaining. in the first half, time shall be restored only if the additional play will be a snap from scrimmage. in the second half, time shall be restored only if the next play will be a snap from scrimmage by a team that is trailing by eight points or less, or by either team if the score is tied. 66rule 15 (3) the game clock is reviewable to determine if it properly expired when on-field officials restore time after the last play of any half, or of an overtime period in the preseason or regular season, or of an overtime half in the postseason. visual evidence that a clock should have stopped includes any situation when the clock stops by rule after the ball becomes dead. visual evidence that the clock should have stopped for a team timeout occurs when an official starts to raise his or her arm to signal a stopped clock. article 10. disqualification of a player. the senior vice president of officiating or his or her designee may review a decision by on-field officials to disqualify a player. when reviewing a disqualification under this article other reviewable aspects of the play will not be reviewed unless the replay official would otherwise have authority to challenge the play, or it is challenged by a head coach. article 11. other reviewable plays. item 1. direction of a pass. whether a pass was forward or backward. note: when an on-field ruling is incomplete, and the pass was clearly backward, the ball will be awarded at the spot of recovery to the team that recovers the ball in the immediate continuing action. if there is no clear recovery, the ball will be awarded to the team last in possession at the spot where possession was lost. item 2. illegal forward pass. whether a pass was illegally thrown. item 3. field goal or try attempt. whether a field goal or try attempt crossed above the crossbar and inside the uprights is reviewable, but only if the ball crosses the plane of the goal post below the top of the uprights, or if the ball touches anything. item 4. illegal forward handoff. whether a player received a handoff clearly in advance of a player making the handoff. item 5. ball touching a foreign object. whether a loose ball touched a scoreboard, guide wire, or any other object. notes: (1) the replay official can initiate a challenge for this item at any time during the game. (2) if it is determined that the ball hit an object, the down will be replayed from the previous spot, and the game clock will be reset to the time when the ball was snapped and will start on the snap. section 4 non-reviewable plays the following aspects of plays are not reviewable: (a) whether an erroneous whistle sounded; (b) whether a ball was illegally batted or kicked; (c) whether a passer intentionally grounded a pass; (d) whether an ineligible receiver was downfield before a pass; (e) whether a receiver was illegally contacted; (f) the spot of a loose ball crossing the sideline; (g) whether a block was illegal; and (h) any aspect of a play not listed as reviewable in section 3 of this rule. section 5 game clock administration article 1. resetting game clock. when a ruling is changed in replay, the clock status following review is determined by rule 4-3, and the game clock will be reset to the time when the ball should have been declared dead. the game clock is not reset if the on-field ruling is not changed in replay. article 2. 10-second runoff. when a changed ruling results in a running clock for plays that begin after the two-minute warning, the clock is reset to the time when the play should have ended, and the clock will run for 10 seconds from the reset time. if less than 10 seconds remain in the half or the game, the half or the game is over. note: neither team may decline a 10-second runoff under this article, but either team can avoid the 10-second runoff by taking a charged team timeout. if the 10-second runoff is avoided, the game clock will be reset to the time when the play should have ended and will start on the snap. section 6 timeouts following challenge article 1. unsuccessful challenge. a team that makes an unsuccessful challenge is charged a team timeout. if a team takes a team timeout and then unsuccessfully challenges a play, it is charged a second timeout. a challenge is considered successful if any reviewable aspect of the play is changed. article 2. charged timeout. a charged timeout taken after the two-minute warning of either half with the clock running will be restored if a review changes the ruling and the new ruling results in a stopped clock. an injury timeout can be charged or restored if a ruling changed in replay would affect whether an injury timeout is charged. section 7 fouls article 1. penalty administration. penalty administration, including the number of the down, yardage, the number of the fouling player, and the spot of a foul, is reviewable. article 2. foul nullified by a changed ruling. a foul will be nullified when a necessary aspect of the foul is changed in replay. a foul can be created following a review if the reviewable aspect creates the foul, or if the referee announced before the review that there was no foul on the play because of a specific ruling that is changed in the review. 67rule 15 article 3. enforcement of fouls following a changed ruling item 1. major fouls. when a ruling is changed in replay, any foul that occurred after the ball should have been declared dead is disregarded except for personal fouls and unsportsmanlike conduct fouls. live-ball fouls that occurred on the challenged play may be enforced if they occurred before the ball should have been declared dead. item 2. pre-snap fouls before challenge. pre-snap fouls, other than personal fouls and unsportsmanlike conduct fouls, that occur before a replay review will be ignored if the ruling on the previous play is changed. item 3. head coach’s ability to change penalty decision. if a ruling is changed in replay, a head coach can change a decision whether to accept or decline a penalty that was made before the review. section 8 loss of communication if communications between the officials and the league office are lost, the referee will stay at the on-field monitor for one minute while communications are being restored. if communications are not restored within one minute, the referee will conduct the replay review in consultation with the replay official. if communications are restored during the review, the league office will review the play as normal. 68rule 16 overtime procedures section 1 overtime procedures article 1. score tied. if the score is tied at the end of the regulation playing time of all regular season and postseason nfl games, a system of modified sudden-death overtime shall be in effect, pursuant to the following. article 2. end of regulation. at the end of regulation playing time, the referee shall immediately toss a coin at the center of the field, in accordance with rules pertaining to a usual pregame toss (4-2-2). the visiting team captain is to again call the toss. article 3. overtime in regular season. following an intermission of no more than three minutes after the end of a regular game, an extra period of 10 minutes shall commence. the following shall apply: (a) both teams must have the opportunity to possess the ball once during the extra period, unless the team that receives the opening kickoff scores a touchdown on its initial possession, in which case it is the winner, or if the team kicking off to start the overtime period scores a safety on the receiving team’s initial possession, in which case the team that kicked off is the winner. if a touchdown is scored, the game is over, and the try is not attempted. (b) if the team that possesses the ball first does not score on its initial possession, the team next scoring by any method shall be the winner. (c) if the team that possesses the ball first scores a field goal on its initial possession, the other team (the second team) shall have the opportunity to possess the ball. (1) if the second team scores a touchdown on its possession, it is the winner. (2) if the second team scores a field goal on its possession, the team next scoring by any method shall be the winner. (3) if the second team does not score on its possession, the game is over, and the first team is the winner, subject to article 5(a) below. (d) there shall be a maximum of one 10-minute period, even if the second team has not had an opportunity to possess the ball or if its initial possession has not ended. if the score is tied at the end of the period, the game shall result in a tie (e) each team shall be entitled to two timeouts, and if there is an excess timeout, the usual rules shall apply (see 4-5). the general provisions for the fourth quarter of a game, including timing, shall apply. article 4. overtime in postseason. following an intermission of no more than three minutes after the end of the regular game, an extra period of 15 minutes shall commence. the following shall apply: (a) both teams must have the opportunity to possess the ball at least once during the extra period, unless the team kicking off to start the overtime period scores a safety on the receiving team’s initial possession, in which case the team that kicked off is the winner. (b) after each team has had an opportunity to possess the ball, if one team has more points than its opponent, it is the winner, subject to article 5(a) below. (c) if the team that possesses the ball first does not score on its initial possession, or if the score is tied after each team has had its opportunity to possess the ball, the team next scoring by any method shall be the winner. (d) if the score is tied at the end of a 15-minute overtime period, or if the second team’s initial possession has not ended, another overtime period will begin, and play will continue, regardless of how many 15-minute periods are necessary. (e) between each overtime period, there shall be a two-minute intermission, but there shall be no halftime intermission after the second period. at the beginning of the third overtime period, the captain who lost the coin toss prior to the first overtime period shall have the first choice of the two privileges in 4-2-2, unless the team that won the coin toss deferred. (f) at the end of the first and third extra periods, etc., teams must change goals in accordance with 4-2-3.

(a) if the first team to possess the ball scores a field goal or touchdown, after which the second team loses possession by an interception or fumble, the down will be permitted to run to its conclusion, and all rules of the game will be enforced as customary, including awarding points scored by either team during the down. only fouls that require the down to be replayed, fouls that negate a score, or palpably unfair acts will be enforced. notes: (1) in such situations, if the player who intercepts the pass or recovers the fumble goes to the ground and makes no effort to advance, the covering official will blow his whistle to end the game. (2) if the second team loses possession by an interception or fumble, but the opponent committed a foul prior to the change of possession, the second team’s possession has not legally ended, and the game cannot end on the down. however, in certain situations, the second team cannot decline the penalty and accept the result of the play, or accept a penalty enforcement, if it would create a second possession for itself. in that situation, it can only accept an enforcement that extends its initial possession. (3) the situation in (2) may also affect the team that receives the opening kickoff during its first possession. if there is a foul by the second team followed by a double change of possession, and the first team accepts the result of the play, the second team has had its required possession, and the first team has possession of the ball for the second time. however, if it accepts the penalty, it will extend its initial possession. 69rule 16 (b) a player is in possession when he has a firm grip and control of the ball inbounds (3-2-7). the defense gains possession when it catches, intercepts, or recovers a loose ball. (c) the opportunity to possess applies only during kicking plays. a kickoff is the opportunity to possess for the receiving team. if the kicking team legally recovers the kick, the receiving team is considered to have had its opportunity. a punt or field goal attempt that crosses the line of scrimmage and is muffed by the receiving team is considered to be an opportunity to possess for the receiving team. normal touching rules by the kicking team apply. (d) all replay reviews will be initiated by the replay official. coaches’ challenges will not be allowed. (e) disqualified player(s) shall not re-enter during any extra period or periods. (f) except as provided for above, all other general and specific rules shall apply. 70rule 17 emergencies, unfair acts section 1 emergencies article 1. non-player on field. if any non-player, including photographers, reporters, employees, police or spectators, enters the field of play or end zones, and in the judgment of an official said party or parties interfere with the play, the referee, after consulting the crew (13-1-7 and 19-1-3), shall enforce any such penalty or score as the interference warrants. article 2. field control. if spectators enter the field and/or interfere with the progress of the game in such a manner that in the opinion of the referee the game cannot continue, the referee shall declare timeout. in such a case, the referee shall record the number of the down, distance to be gained, and the position of the ball on the field. the referee shall also secure from the line judge the playing time remaining and record it. the referee shall then order the home club through its management to have the field cleared, and when it is cleared and order restored and the safety of the spectators, players and officials is assured to the satisfaction of the referee, the game must continue even if it is necessary to use lights. article 3. game called. if the game must be called due to a state or municipal law, or by darkness if no lights are available, an immediate report shall be made to the commissioner by the home club, visiting club, and officials. on receipt of all reports, the commissioner shall make a decision which will be final. article 4. emergency situations. the nfl affirms the position that in most circumstances all regular-season and postseason games should be played to their conclusion. if, in the opinion of appropriate league authorities, it is impossible to begin or continue a game due to an emergency, or a game is deemed to be imminently threatened by any such emergency (e.g., severely inclement weather, lightning, flooding, power failure), the following procedures (articles 5 through 11) will serve as guidelines for the commissioner and/or the duly appointed representatives. the commissioner has the authority to review the circumstances of each emergency and to adjust the following procedures in whatever manner the commissioner deems appropriate. if, in the commissioner’s opinion, it is reasonable to project that the resumption of an interrupted game would not change its ultimate result or adversely affect any other inter-team competitive issue, the commissioner is empowered to terminate the game. article 5. league authority. the league employees vested with the authority to define emergencies under these procedures are the commissioner, designated representatives from the league office staff, and the game referee. in those instances where neither the commissioner nor the designated representative is in attendance at a game, the referee will have sole authority; provided, however, that if the referee delays the beginning of or interrupts a game for a significant period of time due to an emergency, the referee must make every effort to contact the commissioner or the commissioner’s designated representative for consultation. in all cases of significant delay, the league authorities will consult with the management of the participating clubs and will attempt to obtain appropriate information from outside sources, if applicable (e.g., weather bureau, police). article 6. later date. if, because of an emergency, a regular-season or postseason game is not started at its scheduled time and cannot be played at any later time that same day, the game nevertheless must be played on a subsequent date to be determined by the commissioner. article 7. pre-game threat. if there is deemed to be a threat of an emergency that may occur during the playing of a game (e.g., an incoming tropical storm), the starting time of such game will not be moved to an earlier time unless there is clearly sufficient time to make an orderly change. article 8. interrupted game. if, under emergency circumstances, an interrupted regular-season or post-season game cannot be completed on the same day, such game will be rescheduled by the commissioner and resumed at that point. article 9. alternate dates, sites. in instances under these emergency procedures which require the commissioner to reschedule a regular-season game, the commissioner will make every effort to set the game for no later than two days after its originally scheduled date, and will attempt to schedule the game at its original site. if unable to do so, the commissioner will schedule it at the nearest available facility. if it is impossible to schedule the game within two days after its original date, the commissioner will be guided by the emergencies and unfair acts provisions in the policy manual for member clubs: game operations. article 10. postseason interruption. if an emergency interrupts a postseason game and such game cannot be resumed on that same date, the commissioner will make every effort to arrange for its completion as soon as possible. if unable to schedule the game at the same site, the commissioner will select an appropriate alternate site. the commissioner will terminate the game short of completion only, if in the commissioner’s judgment, the continuation of the game would not be normally expected to alter the ultimate result. article 11. game resumption. in all instances where a game is resumed after interruption, either on the same date or a subsequent date, the resumption will begin at the point at which the game was interrupted. at the time of interruption, the referee will call timeout and will make a record of the following: the team possessing the ball, direction in which its offense was headed, position of the ball on the field, down, distance, period, time remaining in the period, and any other pertinent information required for an efficient and equitable resumption of play. section 2 extraordinarily unfair acts article 1. commissioner authority. the commissioner has the sole authority to investigate and take appropriate disciplinary and/or corrective measures if any club action, non-participant interference, or calamity occurs in an nfl game which the commissioner deems so extraordinarily unfair or outside the accepted tactics encountered in professional football that such action has a major effect on the result of the game. article 2. no club protests. the authority and measures provided for in this entire section 2 do not constitute a protest machinery for nfl clubs to avail themselves of in the event a dispute arises over the result of a game. the investigation called 71rule 17 for in this section 2 will be conducted solely on the commissioner’s initiative to review an act or occurrence that the commissioner deems so extraordinary or unfair that the result of the game in question would be inequitable to one of the participating teams. the commissioner will not apply authority in cases of complaints by clubs concerning judgmental errors or routine errors of omission by game officials. games involving such complaints will continue to stand as completed. article 3. penalties for unfair acts. the commissioner’s powers under this section 2 include the imposition of monetary fines and draft-choice forfeitures, suspension of persons involved in unfair acts, and, if appropriate, the reversal of a game’s result or the rescheduling of a game, either from the beginning or from the point at which the extraordinary act occurred. in the event of rescheduling a game, the commissioner will be guided by the procedures specified in 17-1-5–11, above. in all cases, the commissioner will conduct a full investigation, including the opportunity for hearings, use of game video, and any other procedure the commissioner deems appropriate. 72rule 18 guidelines for captains section 1 guidelines for captains article 1. number of captains. one hour and thirty minutes prior to kickoff: respective coaches designate a maximum of six captains per team. article 2. coin toss: (a) up to six captains per team can participate in the coin toss ceremony (active, inactive, or honorary); only one captain from the visiting team (or a captain designated by the referee if there is no home team) can declare the choice of the coin toss. (b) the team that won the toss may then have only one captain declare its option. (c) the team that lost the coin toss may then have only one captain declare its option. article 3. choice on penalty option: only one captain is permitted to indicate the team’s penalty option. article 4. change of captains: (a) the coach has the prerogative of informing the referee when he wishes to make a change in team captains. (b) a captain who is leaving can inform the referee which player will act as captain in his place when he is substituted for. (c) when a captain leaves the game, the incoming substitute is permitted to inform the referee which player the respective coach has designated as captain. note: a captain on the field has no authority to request a change of fellow team captain when that captain remains on the field. 73rule 19 officials section 1 officials article 1. game officials. the game shall be played under the supervision of seven officials: the referee, umpire, down judge, line judge, field judge, side judge, and back judge. in the absence of seven officials, the crew is to be rearranged according to the remaining members of the crew. article 2. jurisdiction. the officials’ jurisdiction begins 100 minutes before the scheduled kickoff and ends when the referee declares the final score. article 3. referee’s authority. the referee is to have general oversight and control of the game. the referee is the final authority for the score. if there is a disagreement between members of the crew regarding the number of down, any decision, or the application, enforcement, or interpretation of a rule, the referee’s decision will be final. the referee’s decisions upon all matters not specifically placed under the jurisdiction of other officials by rule are final. article 4. responsibilities and mechanics. officiating responsibilities and mechanics are specified in the mechanics manual, published annually by the national football league. section 2 support from nfl officiating staff the replay official and designated members of the officiating department at the league office may consult with the on-field officials to provide objective information regarding on-field rulings and the correct application of playing rules. in addition, if the designated members of the officiating department determine that a foul for a football or non-football act called on the field is flagrant, then they can instruct the on-field officiating crew to disqualify the player(s) who committed the foul. those players who were not penalized, but who engaged in football or non-football acts that were determined to be flagrant and directly related to the foul called on the field, may also be disqualified by designated members of the officiating department. a penalty will be assessed when a player was not penalized by on-field officials but was subsequently disqualified pursuant to this section. the determination that a foul is flagrant must be based on the available video provided on the television broadcast, and the designated members of the officiating department must instruct the officiating crew to disqualify the identified player(s) before the ball is next legally put in play. 74distance penalties loss of five yards delay of game

throws the ball forward out of bounds. seven minutes remain in the game. ruling: a’s ball, third-and-4 on a42. illegal forward pass. the clock starts on the snap. (3-22-4, 8-1-1) a.r. 3.2 intentional fumble forward—after two-minute warning fourth-and-10 on b35. with 1:22 left in the game, and team b ahead 21-20, a1 scrambles to the b21 and intentionally fumbles the ball forward to the b20 where it is recovered by b1 who returns it to the b22. ruling: b’s ball, first-and-10 on b26. this is an illegal forward pass thrown from beyond the line and is dead (incomplete) when it hits the ground. (3-2-5). the five-yard penalty is enforced from the spot of the pass, which takes the ball back to a spot that is short of the line to gain. the loss of down results in the ball going over to team b on downs. (3-22-4, 8-1-1). there is no 10-second runoff because the result after enforcement is a change of possession. a.r. 3.3 fumble—out of bounds third-and-4 on a35. a1 runs to the a41, is tackled near the sideline, and fumbles the ball. b1, on his feet, gains control of the ball at the sideline at the a39 with one foot inbounds, and then his second foot hits out of bounds. ruling: a’s ball, first-and-10 on a39. b1 did not possess the ball with two feet inbounds. the ball is placed at the out of bounds spot, since it was behind the spot of the fumble, and the game clock starts on the referee’s signal that a ball has been returned to the field of play. (3-2-5, 4-3-2). a.r. 3.4 dot the i—complete/incomplete catch second-and-10 on a35. a1 throws a forward pass to a2 at the a47 sideline. while a2 is stretched out over the sideline, he controls the ball and “hangs” over the sideline with both feet contacting the ground inbounds: (a) the first thing to hit the ground out of bounds is the point of the ball, but the ball does not move in his hands; or (b) as he lands on his shoulder out of bounds, he loses possession of the ball. rulings: (a) first-and-10 on a47. completed catch. (3-2-7-note 2) (b) third-and-10 on a35. incomplete pass. (3-2-7-note 2) a.r. 3.5 loose ball between legs of player—no possession second-and-10 on b40. a1 runs with the ball to the b30 where he fumbles. in the scramble for the loose ball, b1 ends up on the ground with the ball securely held between his legs, although his hands/arms are not around the ball. a2, while standing on his feet, reaches down and pulls the ball from b2 and runs for a touchdown. ruling: touchdown. kickoff a35. possession requires control with the hands or arms. (3-2-7-item 1) a.r. 3.6 pass controlled at sideline—player knocked out of bounds before two feet down first-and-10 on a30. a1 throws a pass for a2 near the sideline at the 50. b1 leaps near the sideline to intercept, controls the ball, and comes down with one foot inbounds. his second foot would have come down inbounds, but a2 shoves him out of bounds. ruling: second-and-10 on a30. incomplete pass. (3-2-7, 8-1-3) a.r. 3.7 drop kick from a legal free kick formation, kicker a1 drops the ball at the a35-yard line, where he kicks it into the air immediately after it bounces off the ground. b1 signals for a fair catch and catches the ball at the 50. ruling: b’s ball, first-and-10 on 50. legal fair catch. b1’s fair catch signal is valid because the ball did not touch the ground after it was kicked. if the kicker attempts a drop kick, but does not kick the ball as, or immediately after, it touches the ground, the kick is illegal, and officials should blow the play dead. a.r. 3.8 penalty for disqualified player failing to leave bench area in the third quarter, a2 is disqualified from the game for slugging an opponent. the referee properly advises the head coach that the player must be removed from the bench area. near the end of the third quarter, the referee notices the player in street clothes in the bench area after having been told to leave. ruling: fifteen-yard penalty for unsportsmanlike conduct, and the disqualified player is removed from the playing area. (3-8) a.r. 3.9 fair-catch signal—behind the line fourth-and-7 on a40. a1’s punt is blocked and it goes straight up in the air behind the line of scrimmage. b1 signals for a fair catch (valid or invalid) on the a36 and is tackled immediately by a3. ruling: b’s ball, first-and-10 on a36. no foul by a3 or b1 since a fair catch cannot occur behind the line of scrimmage. (3-10) a.r. 3.10 dead-ball foul—after first down made second-and-6 on a38. a1 runs to the 50 and is tackled. immediately after the play, a3 clips b4 at the a48. ruling: first-and-10 on a35. a dead-ball foul is enforced from the succeeding spot. however, a made the line to gain, thus it is a first down and ten yards to go after a 15-yard penalty. (3-14-1, 14-4-9) 4 a.r. 3.11 team a pass intercepted in b’s end zone—fumble—impetus third-and-6 on b24. b1 intercepts a pass in his end zone and attempts to run it out. he is tackled in the end zone and fumbles the ball out of bounds over the end line. ruling: b’s ball, first-and-10 on b20. touchback. (3-17) a.r. 3.12 team a blocks team b player into punt—touching / impetus fourth-and-5 on a44. a1 punts and the ball is nearly at rest when a2 blocks b3 (high) into the ball (new impetus). b3 was not attempting to block or recover the ball. the ball goes into the end zone where a3 falls on it. ruling: b’s ball, first-and-10 on b20. touchback. the touching of the ball by b3 is ignored, so the ball is dead for a touchback when the punted ball hits in the end zone, untouched by team b. note: the impetus that puts the ball into the end zone is a2’s block of passive b3, (who is not attempting to block or recover the ball). if the official feels the block by a2 was unnecessary, a2 could be flagged for hitting a player out of the play and penalized for unnecessary roughness. a.r. 3.13 blocked punt into end zone—impetus fourth-and-10 on a7. a’s punt is partially blocked by b1. b2 muffs the ball at the a10, and the ball rebounds into a’s end zone where: (a) a2 falls on it; (b) a3 and b3 simultaneously recover it; or (c) the ball rolls over the end line. rulings: (a) safety. (3-29, 3-17) (b) touchdown. (11-2-1, 3-17) (c) safety. (3-17, 11-5-1) note: if a had recovered in the field of play, it would have been a’s ball, first-and-10 since team b touched the ball beyond the line of scrimmage. a.r. 3.14 bat by team b on punt into team b end zone fourth-and-10 on 50. a1's punt is rolling on the b10 when b1 bats the ball backward out of the back of the end zone. at the time of the bat, the rolling punt was: (a) nearly at rest; or (b) still rolling toward the sideline (not nearly at rest). rulings: (a) and (b) safety b, safety kick b20. note: the bat is legal in both (a) and (b), but any bat of a loose ball creates a new impetus. a.r. 3.15 runner dives - hits pylon - ball in team b end zone third-and-goal on b3. a1 dives at the b1, and his shoulder hits the pylon with the ball in his right arm at the b½-yard line. he continues into the end zone where his chest is the first thing to touch the ground, hitting in the end zone just after the ball crosses the goal line extended. ruling: touchdown. kickoff a35. (3-21-1) a.r. 3.16 pylon—goal line extended second-and-goal on b5. a2, running to his right, is contacted by b2, and as he is going down at the b1, he dives toward the pylon. the ball is held in his right hand extended over the out of bounds area but beyond the extended goal line, when his chest hits: (a) the ground, just short of the goal line (a2’s chest is the first thing to hit the ground); (b) the pylon, after which he lands out of bounds beyond the goal line extended; or (c) the ground in the end zone. the ball crossed the sideline at the b½-yard line, but it never went over the top of the pylon. rulings: (a) third-and-goal on b½. since the runner was down short of the goal line, the ball must break the goal-line plane, hit the pylon, or go over the top of the pylon for a touchdown. (b) third-and-goal on b½. since the runner was out of bounds, the ball must break the goal-line plane between the pylons, hit the pylon, or go over the top of the pylon for a touchdown. (c) touchdown, as the ball broke the plane of the extended goal line, and the runner was not down until he was in the end zone. (3-39, 11-2-1) a.r. 3.17 runner touching out of bounds player third-and-goal on b7. runner a2 runs toward the sideline and is inbounds at the b1-yard line when he touches a3 who is out of bounds at the time. a2 then scores. ruling: touchdown. (3-21-1) a.r. 3.18 runner touching out of bounds official on a kickoff, b1 catches the ball near the sideline and then touches the line judge who is standing on the sideline at the b10. b1 goes out of bounds at the b18. ruling: b’s ball, first-and-10 on b18. (3-21-1) a.r. 3.19 player out of bounds touches loose ball in bounds third-and-4 on a43. a1 runs to the a49 where b1, who is standing out of bounds, strips or knocks the ball loose from a1, making contact with the ball after knocking it loose. b2 recovers at the b48. ruling: a’s ball, first-and-10 on a49. this is considered a loose ball touching a player out of bounds and the ball is dead. if the ball does not come loose or the out of bounds player does not make contact with the ball, the play is not dead. (3-21-3) 5 a.r. 3.20 player out of bounds—bats loose ball on a kickoff from the a35, the ball is rolling near the sideline at the b15. b2’s right foot steps on the sideline, his left foot then steps down inbounds at the b15, and b2 then bats the ball forward and out of bounds at the b25. ruling: b’s ball, first-and-10 on b40. kickoff out of bounds. b2 never re-established possession inbounds. the ball was out of bounds when b2 touched it so there is no foul for an illegal bat. (3-21-3) a.r. 3.21 team a fumble—b recovers and runs for touchdown—dead ball foul by team b second-and-7 on b45. shotgun quarterback a1 hands the ball forward to running back a2 at the b48. a2 muffs the handoff, and b3 recovers it and runs for a touchdown. after the touchdown, b4 slugs a3. ruling: touchdown for team b. team a has the option to have the penalty enforced on the try or the kickoff. disqualify b4. (3-2-6, 14-4-9) a.r. 3.22 illegal forward pass third-and-5 on a40. a2 is running with the ball at the b30 where he tosses it underhand to a3 who catches it at the b29. a3 continues on for an apparent touchdown. ruling: a’s ball, first-and-10 on b35. this is an illegal forward pass. (3-22-4) a.r. 3.23 team b bats backward pass out of team a’s end zone third-and-5 on a7. quarterback a1 attempts a backward pass to a3 from the a4. b1 bats the pass over the end line. ruling: safety. safety kick from a20. (3-17, 3-22-5). a new impetus is not created unless the backward pass has first struck the ground (3-17-c) a.r. 3.24 illegal scrimmage kick—beyond line—recovered by team a behind line fourth-and-6 on a35. punter a1 runs to the a37 and punts the ball. it is blocked by b1 and rolls behind the line to the a33. a2 picks up the ball and runs to the 50. ruling: fourth-and-14 on a27. the illegal kick foul must be accepted or it would be a’s ball, 1-10-50. (3-18 and 9-1-1-notes 1 and 2) a.r. 3.25 illegally kicking/batting loose ball behind line of scrimmage fourth-and-5 on b30. quarterback a1 muffs the hand-to-hand snap, and while the ball is loose on the ground at the b31, (a) a1 deliberately kicks it, causing it to go out of bounds at the b24, or (b) a1 bats the ball, causing it to go out of bounds at the b24. rulings: (a) and (b) b’s ball, first-and-10 on b40. illegally kicking or batting a loose ball behind the line of scrimmage is enforced 10 yards from the previous spot, and a loss of down. note: illegally batting or kicking the ball is a 10-yard penalty, and if by team a, also a loss of down. the one exception is if the foul is by team a beyond the line of scrimmage, during a scrimmage kick, in which case there is no loss of down. in all other respects, and at all times, the foul is enforced pursuant to normal enforcement principles, based on the type of play during which it occurs. (12-5-1, 12-5-2) a.r. 3.26 fumble into and out of end zone third-and-7 on a11. a1 fumbles the ball on the a8 where b1 recovers the ball, advances to the a2, where he is hit and fumbles the ball out of bounds through the end zone. ruling: a’s ball, first-and-10 on a20. touchback. (3-38, 8-7-3) a.r. 3.27 illegal touch and muffed punt into end zone fourth-and-5 on 50. a1 punts the ball to the b5 where a2 touches the ball. b3 then muffs the ball, and it continues into and out of the end zone. ruling: b’s ball, first-and-10 on b20. touchback. (3-38, 11-6-1) a.r. 3.28 muffed snap—try during a kick or two-point try, the snap is muffed by holder a2 or qba1. in attempting to recover, a1 or a2 muffs the ball into the end zone where a5 recovers. ruling: try good. award two points to team a. kickoff a35. since this is a muffed backward pass, it is legal for a5 to recover the ball. had it been a fumble, only the fumbling player could recover. (3-32, 3-41, 8-7-1-note) a.r. 3.29 2-point try—5 vs. 15 before the ball is snapped from the b2 on a 2-point try, a2 false starts, and b2 then roughs quarterback a1. ruling: re-try b2 and kickoff 50; re-try b1 and kickoff a35; re-try b7½ for 1-point kick-try and kickoff a35; or re-try b15 for 1-point kick-try and kickoff 50. (3-41) a.r. 3.30 2-point try—5 vs. 15 before the ball is snapped from the 2-yard line, b1 encroaches and a3 then punches b2. ruling: re-try b17 for 2-point try; or re-try b30 for kick-try. in neither case is there an option to enforce team a’s pre-snap foul on the kickoff. disqualify a3. (3-41) 6 a.r. 3.31 ball hits indoor scoreboard or skycam - foul by team a on the play fourth-and-4 on a30. the game is played in a stadium with a scoreboard gondola hanging from the ceiling, or a skycam. back a2 is illegally in motion forward at the snap. the punt is a high kick that hits the scoreboard or skycam and comes down at the b45 where b1 catches it and returns it to the a15 where he is downed. ruling: fourth-and-4 on a30. void the play. the illegal motion foul is declined by rule. the ball is dead. (7-2-1-a) return the game clock to what it read when the ball was snapped, and the clock would start on the snap. (same ruling on any play. if the ball hits the scoreboard or skycam, the down is replayed and only personal fouls or unsportsmanlike conduct fouls are enforced, from the previous spot.) this may be reviewed by replay official at any time or challenged by either coach outside two minutes of either half. rule 4 game timing general timing rules a.r. 4.1 between periods—coach on the field during the intermission between the first and second periods, while the referee and umpire are preparing to move the ball to the other end of the field, the referee suddenly discovers team a’s head coach in the middle of the field arguing about the last play of the quarter. ruling: penalize team a 15 yards from the succeeding spot for the coach illegally entering the field. this is a foul if it occurs at any point during the game. since the coach is being penalized for being on the field, as opposed to what he is saying to the official, (or how he is saying it), this is not the type of foul that counts toward a potential disqualification. a.r. 4.2 coin toss—captains at the coin toss: (a) a coach refuses to send any captains to the middle of the field to participate in the coin-toss ceremony; or (b) a coach sends out his entire team to the middle of the field to participate in the ceremony; or (c) a coach sends out his six team captains to the middle of the field to participate in the coin toss. two of these captains are injured and are not in uniform for this game. rulings: (a) loss of coin-toss option for both halves and loss of 15 yards from spot of opening kickoff. at least one captain from each team is required to be present for the coin toss. (b) loss of coin-toss option for both halves and loss of 15 yards from spot of opening kickoff. captains are limited to six per team. (c) legal. a team is limited to six captains: active, inactive, or honorary. a.r. 4.3 coin toss—invalid toss after getting the call from the visiting team captain, the referee tosses the coin in the air, but it does not turn over before hitting the ground. ruling: the coin toss is void and another toss is made. the visiting team captain cannot change his original call. if the coin does not turn over, or in the referee’s judgment the toss has been compromised in some way, there will be another toss. a.r. 4.4 fumble—out of bounds third-and-7 on a45. a2 runs to the 50 and fumbles the ball out of bounds at the a47. ruling: fourth-and-5 on a47, and the game clock starts as a new ball is brought back into the field of play. (4-3-2) a.r. 4.5 fumble—after two-minute warning second-and-10 on b40 with 1:30 left in the game. a1 fumbles at the b36 and the fumble is recovered by a2 at the b34 where he picks up the ball and runs with it. ruling: since a teammate other than the fumbling player recovers the fumble after the two-minute warning, the play is blown dead when a2 recovers. unless there is a significant delay in spotting the ball at the b36, the game clock continues to run, and the play clock begins immediately, as normal. if the ball is not in the vicinity of the b36, and a delay in retrieving and spotting it will create a time disadvantage for either team, the game clock will be stopped, and the play clock frozen. the referee will re-start the clocks as soon as the ball is retrieved and is being brought back to the b36, and he will quickly advise the quarterback that the clocks are starting. a.r. 4.6 fumble forward out of bounds—after two-minute warning second-and-10 on b40 with 1:30 left in the game. a1 fumbles at the b36 and the fumble rolls out of bounds at the b34. ruling: third-and-6 on b36. the game clock will stop when the ball rolls out of bounds. it should be restarted by the referee as the ball is being brought back into the field before it is spotted at the hash mark. (the referee should advise the quarterback that the game clock will start.) the play clock starts when the play is blown dead and continues to run. 7 a.r. 4.7 fumble after two-minute warning—end zone involvement second-and-goal on b6. thirty seconds remain in the game. a2 takes a handoff behind the line. a2 is tackled at the b4 and fumbles with the ball going into the end zone. a3 recovers the ball in the end zone. ruling: third-and-goal on b4. the clock will stop upon the recovery. it should be restarted by the referee as the ball is being brought back into the field before it is spotted at the hash mark. (the referee should advise the quarterback that the game clock will start.) the play clock starts when the play is blown dead and continues to run. if this same scenario occurs, but the ball is recovered in team a’s end zone, the play is blown dead immediately and results in a safety. a.r. 4.8 backward pass out of bounds—before two-minute warning second-and-5 on a35. quarterback a1 throws a backward pass to a3 who muffs the ball at the a32 and the ball goes out of bounds there. four minutes remain in the second half. ruling: third-and-8 on a32. the game clock is stopped when the ball goes out of bounds, but it is restarted by the referee, before it is spotted, when the new ball is being brought back into the field. (advise the quarterback that the clock is being started). a.r. 4.9 backward pass out of bounds—after two-minute warning third-and-8 on a30. a1 pitches back to a2 at the a25. a2 muffs the pitch and the ball goes out of bounds at the a35 with 30 seconds left to play in the second quarter. ruling: third-and-13 on a25 (illegal action to conserve time), or fourth-and-3 on a35 (decline penalty). if the penalty is accepted, run 10 seconds (0:20) and wind the clock. team b can accept the penalty yardage and decline the runoff. if the runoff is declined, or team a uses a timeout to avoid the runoff, the clock will start on the snap. if team b declines the penalty, then there is no runoff and the clock starts on the snap. a.r. 4.10 runner out of bounds—five minutes or more in fourth quarter third-and-6 on a21. runner a2 goes out of bounds at the a31 with exactly five minutes (or more) remaining in the fourth quarter. ruling: a’s ball, first-and-10 on a31. the game clock is started when an official spots the ball at the inbounds spot, and the referee gives the signal to start the game clock. if the game clock was at 4:59 when the runner went out of bounds, it would start on the next snap. a.r. 4.11 kickoff/safety kick—starting game clock a kickoff from the a35, or a safety kick from the a20, occurs at any time of the game. ruling: the game clock starts when the ball is legally touched in the field of play, or when the receivers advance the ball from their end zone into the field of play. a.r. 4.12 holder for field goal sacked—third down—status of game clock third-and-2 on b15 with the clock stopped with 15 seconds left in the game. team a, with no timeouts left and behind by two points, decides to attempt a field goal on third down. the ball is snapped to the holder, but he is tackled at the b23 before the kick can be made. ruling: a’s ball, fourth-and-10 on b23. the game clock continues to run. a.r. 4.13 runner is tackled inbounds - delay by the defense—time expires in period third-and-10 on b15 with 13 seconds left in the second quarter. a2 catches a pass near the sideline but is tackled inbounds at the b8 with eight seconds left. b1 and b2 lie on a2 not allowing him to get up (0:05). time runs out in the period. ruling: a’s ball, first-and-goal on b4. delay of game. reset the clock to 0:05 and start on the snap. a.r. 4.14 game and play clock stopped—coach attempts replay challenge second-and-2 on b30 with the game clock running. as team a breaks the huddle, team b head coach throws the red flag to challenge the prior play. the referee stops both clocks with 14 seconds on the play clock. after discussion with the coach, it is determined that the play is not reviewable, so no challenge is granted, and a timeout is not charged. ruling: second-and-2 on b30. after advising both teams that there are 14 seconds on the play clock and giving them a reasonable opportunity to get ready, the referee starts the play clock at 14 seconds and winds both clocks. a.r. 4.15 game clock stopped - play clock running—chains tangled third-and-10 on a45. with the game clock stopped due to an incomplete pass on the prior play, and the play clock running at 28 seconds, the down judge stops the game because the chains are tangled and are not set. ruling: third-and-10 on a45. after fixing the chains and advising both teams and giving them a reasonable opportunity to get ready, the referee starts the play clock at 28 seconds. the game clock starts on the snap. a.r. 4.16 play clock interrupted inside 10 seconds—injured player fourth-and-1 on b35 with 3:33 remaining in the game and the game clock running as quarterback a1 is under center and calling signals, b2 suddenly collapses, apparently injured. the play clock is at seven seconds when the game is stopped for the injured player. ruling: fourth-and-1 on b35. b2 must leave the game (or call a timeout). after b2 leaves the game, and after the referee has advised both teams and given them a reasonable opportunity to get ready, the referee resets the play 8 clock to 10 seconds and winds both clocks on the ready-for-play signal. if a timeout was taken, the play clock would be set to 25 seconds and started on the ready-for-play signal. a.r. 4.17 play clock interrupted inside 10 seconds—injured player—referee discretion second-and-8 on a35 with 2:45 remaining in the 4th quarter. the game clock is running with team b out of timeouts and team a leading 21-20. as quarterback a1 is under center and calling signals, a2 suddenly collapses, apparently injured. the play clock is at :04 and the game clock is at 2:09 when the game is stopped for the injured player. ruling: second-and-8 on a35. both play clock and game clock will remain at the same time as when the game was stopped. a2 must leave the game (or call a timeout). after a2 leaves the game, and after the referee has advised both teams and given them reasonable opportunity to get ready, the referee winds both clocks on the ready-for-play signal. this prevents time from being added to the play clock that would allow team a to run the game clock to the two-minute warning. if no such timing advantage exists, the play clock will be set to 10 seconds. a.r. 4.18 clock status after blocked field goal third-and-5 on b10. with eight seconds remaining in a tied game, team a attempts a field goal from the b18. the attempt is blocked, and a1 recovers and is tackled at the b12. team a has used all of its timeouts. ruling: fourth-and-7 on b12. the clock continues to run and will likely expire, as there has been no change of possession. a.r. 4.19 clock status after punt—penalty team a fourth-and-10 on 50. team a is in an illegal formation. a1’s punt, at 10:00 of the first quarter, rolls dead untouched at the b1. ruling: fourth-and-15 on a45, or b’s ball, first-and-10 on b6. the clock will start on the snap because it was stopped for the change of possession. a.r. 4.20 clock status after change of possession—foul on play second-and-10 on a35. with 8:30 remaining in the third quarter, a1 fumbles the ball at the a30, where it is recovered and downed by b1. b1 was offside on the play. ruling: a’s ball, second-and-5 on a40. the clock starts on the snap, because it was stopped for the change of possession. if there is a change of possession during the down, the game clock will start on the snap, regardless of whether the change of possession is negated by a penalty. a.r. 4.21 clock status after foul that prevents the snap—fourth quarter or overtime fourth-and-10 on b45. with 6:00 remaining in the fourth quarter and the clock running, lineman a1 commits a false start. ruling: a’s ball, fourth-and-15 on 50. false start. the clock starts on the snap, because the offense committed a foul that prevented the snap in the fourth quarter. the clock starts on the snap regardless of whether the foul is accepted or declined. a foul is considered to prevent the snap if it is committed after the ball is made ready for play and causes the clock to stop before a snap. a.r. 4.22 clock status after double foul before the snap—fourth quarter or overtime fourth-and-10 on b45. with 6:00 remaining in the fourth quarter and the clock running, lineman a1 commits a false start and defensive lineman b1 comes across the line and forcibly shoves a1 to the ground. ruling: a’s ball, first-and-10 on b30. false start and unnecessary roughness. this is a 5-15 enforcement where the fst is disregarded by rule and the unr foul is enforced against team b. the clock starts on the ready for play because this is not an offensive foul that prevents the snap since the team b foul is the only foul enforced by rule. a.r. 4.23 clock status after disqualification first-and-10 on a20. a1 takes a handoff and runs to the a30, where he is tackled. officials call a use of helmet foul on tackler b1. after enforcement, and the play clock at 0:17, the officiating department stops the game and instructs officials to disqualify b1. ruling: a’s ball first-and-10 on a45. b1 is disqualified. the play clock remains at 0:17 and will start on the referee’s signal. a.r. 4.24 flag pickup—last two minutes third-and-4 on b25. runner a1 is downed inbounds after a gain of two yards. immediately after the play, b1 pushes a2, and the umpire throws his flag for unnecessary roughness. after discussion with the referee, the umpire picks up his flag, as there was not significant enough contact to call a foul on the play. the time remaining in the game is 1:06. ruling: fourth-and-2 on b23. reset the play clock to 40 seconds and start the game clock and play clock on the referee’s ready-for-play signal. a.r. 4.25 onside kick—no return—timing with 0:03 remaining in the second quarter, a1 attempts an onside kick from the a35. the kick is immediately caught or recovered legally at the a46: (a) by a2; (b) by b1 who signals for and completes a fair catch; (c) by b1 on his feet and he immediately goes to the ground; (d) by b1 on the ground and he makes no effort to get up or advance; (e) by a2 after first being legally touched by a7 on the a47; or (f) by a2 after first being illegally touched by a7 on the a44. 9 rulings: (a) a’s ball, first-and-10 on a46. 0:03 on the clock. (no time runs off the clock). (b) b’s ball, first-and-10 on a46. 0:03 on the clock. (no time runs off the clock). (c) b’s ball, first-and-10 on a46. 0:02 on the clock. (one second runs off the clock). (d) b’s ball, first-and-10 on a46. 0:02 on the clock. (one second runs off the clock). (e) a’s ball, first-and-10 on a46. the clock starts upon the legal touching by a7, so at least one second will run off the clock. (f) b’s ball, first-and-10 on a44. 0:03 on the clock. no time runs off the clock, because the ball was not legally touched prior to a’s recovery. team b can take the ball at the spot of the illegal touch, or re-kick with a 5-yard penalty. the penalty cannot be assessed from the dead ball spot, because team a has legal possession at the end of the down. injury timeouts a.r. 4.26 team a player injured—excess timeout first-and-10 on b36. forty seconds remain in the first half. team a leads 17-14 and has used three timeouts previously in the half. ball carrier a1 runs to the b31 and is downed inbounds. a2 is injured. ruling: second-and-5 on b31. charge team a with its fourth timeout, and after the injured player has left the field, run 10 seconds and wind the clock. the play clock is reset to 25 seconds. b can decline the runoff, but there is no option to start the clock on the snap unless team b takes a timeout. a2 must remain out for one play unless team b calls a timeout. a.r. 4.27 excess timeout under two minutes — prevents clock from starting second-and-3 on b33. a1 runs to the b25, where he is hit and fumbles the ball, which goes out of bounds at the b23 with 50 seconds remaining in the first half. both teams have used all timeouts. a1 is injured on the play. ruling: a’s ball, first-and-10 on b25 (0:40). charge team a with its fourth timeout, run 10 seconds and wind the clock when the ball is ready for play. team b has an option to decline the runoff. a1 must remain out for one play. the excess timeout delays the clock from starting on the ready for play once the ball is returned inbounds, so there is a 10-second runoff (4-5-4, note 3). a.r. 4.28 team requests fourth timeout — ignored prior to the two-minute warning of either half, team a gains 15 yards and a first down and is tackled inbounds at the b40. team a had previously used three timeouts and requests a fourth timeout. ruling: a’s ball, first-and-10 on b40. the request for a timeout is ignored. if the timeout is incorrectly granted, it will count as team a’s fourth timeout, team a will be penalized five yards for delay of game, and the game clock will be started on the ready for play. a.r. 4.29 fifth timeout charged — team b third-and-4 on b22. forty seconds remain in the game. a1 throws an incomplete pass. b1 is injured and team b had previously used four team timeouts in the half. ruling: a’s ball, first-and-10 on b17. charge team b with their fifth team timeout which requires a five-yard penalty. set the play clock to 40 seconds, and the game clock starts on the snap, because of the incomplete pass. b1 is suspended for one play. a.r. 4.30 team a or b player injured—excess timeout—fifth third-and-2 on b17. a1 runs to the b15 and is downed inbounds with 30 seconds remaining in the game. (a) a2 or (b) b2 is injured on the play. the score is tied, and both teams have used four timeouts previously in the half. rulings: (a) a’s ball, first-and-15 on b20. charge team a with their fifth timeout. five-yard penalty, run 10, and start the clock on the ready-for-play signal. (b) a’s ball, first-and-5 on b10. charge team b with their fifth timeout. five-yard penalty. set the play clock to 40, and start the clock on the ready for play, because the clock was running at the end of the play. note: a fifth injury time out is a foul between downs, so it does not offset with other fouls, and it is enforced after the chains are set. if the clock was running at the end of the previous down: if an a player was injured, team b has the option to run 10 and start the clock on the ready for play. if a b player was injured, the play clock is set to 40, and the game clock is started as if the excess timeout had not occurred. a.r. 4.31 injury caused by foul second-and-7 on b15. a1 runs to the b12 and is leg whipped on the tackle by b2. there is 0:55 left in the game. team a had previously used three timeouts in the half, and a1 is injured on the play. ruling: a’s ball, first-and-goal on b6. there is not a charged timeout or a 10 second runoff, because the injury was caused by a foul. a1 can remain in the game. the game clock starts on the snap because of the foul. a.r. 4.32 clock stopped by foul/change of possession—injury on play fourth-and-10 on b20. twenty seconds remain in the game with the clock running. team a has no timeouts remaining and is behind 21-17. at the snap: (a) team a; or (b) team b is offside, and a1 runs to the b17 and is downed inbounds. a2 is injured and attendants must enter the field. 10 rulings: (a) b’s ball, first-and 10 on b17. team b will decline a’s offside. there is no timeout charged (due to the change of possession). a2 must leave the game for one play unless a team timeout is taken. (b) fourth-and-5 on b15. by rule, failing to make a first down on fourth down is a change of possession. therefore, there is no timeout charged, although a2 must leave the game for one play unless a team timeout is taken. note: there is no runoff and the game clock will start on the snap, both because the clock was stopped for the change of possession, and because there was a foul by either team on the play. a.r. 4.33 clock running—team a injury on play fourth-and-2 on b20. twenty seconds remain in the game with the clock running. team a has one timeout remaining and is behind 21-17. a1 runs to the b17 and is downed inbounds. a2 is injured and attendants must enter the field. ruling: a’s ball, first-and-10 on b17. charge team a with its final timeout. there is no runoff, and a2 can remain in the game, because of the charged timeout. (there is no option to run 10 seconds instead of using the timeout.) a.r. 4.34 team timeout and injury to opponent third-and-10 on b40. a1 runs to the b25 where he is tackled inbounds with 30 seconds left in the game. team a calls timeout, and significantly later, b1 drops to the ground, injured. trainers come on and assist b1 off the field. ruling: first-and-10 on b25. team a is charged with the timeout. team b is not charged with a timeout unless b’s injury occurred after the ready-for-play signal had been given for the next down. b1 could remain in the game, due to the charged team timeout. a.r. 4.35 injuries—team a and team b first-and-10 on a41. thirty seconds remain in the game. a1 runs to the b40, where he is tackled inbounds. a3 and b4 are both injured on the play. ruling: first-and-10 on b40. charge each team with a timeout; the play clock is set to 25 seconds; and the game clock is started with the snap, unless both timeouts were excess, in which case the clock starts on the ready-for-play signal. no excess timeout fouls are enforced and there can be no 10-second runoff. if either team had a timeout left, it is used, thus allowing both players to remain in the game. a.r. 4.36 injuries—team a and team b thirty seconds remain in the game. a1 is injured and charged with a timeout. b2 is injured downfield but discovered significantly after team a was charged with the injury timeout. ruling: team a and team b are both charged with injury timeouts. both players would be allowed to stay in the game. no excess timeout fouls are enforced. a.r. 4.37 injuries—two players from same team third-and-3 on a35 in the third quarter. quarterback a1 throws a pass over the middle to the 50. b1 and b2 are both hurt and helped by trainers. an injury timeout is taken for team b. b1 gets up on his own. b2 is carried off the field. ruling: first-and-10 on 50. both b1 and b2 must leave for one play or take a team timeout. a.r. 4.38 injury—after change of possession/touchdown second-and 10 on b25. with 1:10 remaining in the fourth quarter, a1’s pass is (a) intercepted by b2 and returned to the 50, or (b) caught by a2 for a touchdown. a3 is injured on the play, and trainers come on the field after the play to attend to him. rulings: (a) b’s ball, first-and-10 on 50. due to the change of possession, team a is not charged with an injury timeout. (b) touchdown team a. due to the touchdown, team a is not charged with an injury timeout. note: in either case, a3 must go out for a play, unless a team timeout is taken. a.r. 4.39 injury—after field-goal attempt fourth-and-15 on b25. with 1:35 remaining in the fourth quarter, a1’s field-goal attempt from the b32 is: (a) good; (b) blocked, recovered by b2, and returned for a touchdown; or (c) blocked and recovered behind the line by a2 who runs and is downed at the b5. b3 is injured on the play, and trainers come on the field after the play to attend to him. rulings: (a) because of the successful field goal, no injury timeout is charged to team b. b3 must go out for one play. (b) because of either the change of possession or touchdown, no injury timeout is charged to team b. b3 must go out for one play. (c) a’s ball, first-and-goal on b5. team b is charged a timeout, because there was no change of possession. b3 may stay in the game because of the charged timeout. a.r. 4.40 injury—play clock expires at two-minute warning third-and-1 on b45. quarterback a1 tries a sneak and is legally tackled at the line of scrimmage for no gain, and is injured on the play. the referee signals timeout and the clock is stopped at exactly 2:25 in the fourth quarter. substitute quarterback a2 enters the game and the referee winds both clocks. however, quarterback a2 allows the play clock to run down to :00, with the game clock showing 2:00. ruling: two-minute warning. no foul for a delay as long as the play clock and game clock are on the same second, even if one is slightly off the other. the injured player (a1) may return after the two-minute warning. 11 a.r. 4.41 successive timeouts—injured player returns second-and-14 on b40 (third quarter). a2 runs to the b35 where he is downed, and he is hurt on the play. the referee takes an injury timeout for a2. after two minutes, the referee declares the ball ready for play after a2 is removed from the game. team b then calls a timeout. the referee grants a 30-second timeout. after the timeout, team a calls a timeout, and a2 re-enters the game. ruling: a’s ball, third-and-9 on b35. successive timeouts by each team are legal and a2 may return after either team a’s or team b’s timeout. a.r. 4.42 foul on the play—injury—change of possession fourth-and-10 on 50. with team a trailing 23-17, and 0:35 remaining in the fourth quarter, a1’s pass falls incomplete. defensive pass interference is called at the b10 on the play. while the foul is being reported to the referee, he notices attendants have come on the field because tackle a3 was hurt at the line of scrimmage. ruling: a’s ball, first-and-goal on b10. there is not a charged injury timeout, due to the change of possession prior to enforcement of the penalty (failure to make a first down on fourth down). however, a3 must leave for one play unless a timeout is called. a.r. 4.43 foul on the play/touchdown—injury third-and-10 on 50. with 0:35 remaining in the fourth quarter, team a has previously been charged with four timeouts. the pass is complete to a2 for a touchdown. offensive pass interference is called on the play. while the foul is being reported to the referee, he notices attendants have come on the field because tackle a3 was hurt at the line of scrimmage. ruling: a’s ball, third-and-20 on a40. no excess timeout due to the touchdown prior to enforcement of team a’s foul. a3 must leave the game for one play, (unless a timeout is called). a.r. 4.44 timeout restored after injury - after two-minute warning first-and-10 on a40. with 1:23 remaining in a tied game, a1 slides down at the a48 where he jumps up and calls a timeout, which is granted. after the referee announces the timeout, it is discovered that b1 was injured on the play, and team b trainers have already come on the field, or thereafter come on the field, to assist b1. ruling: second-and-2 on a48. team a’s timeout is restored, and team b is charged with a timeout. if it is an excess timeout, b1 must leave for 1 play, the play clock is set to :40, and the game clock starts on the ready. if team b has remaining timeouts, they are charged a timeout, (or if team a still wants a charged timeout), in which case, b1 can remain in the game, the play clock is set to :25, and the game clock starts on the snap. a.r. 4.45 fifth timeout—team b third-and-4 on b22, with 40 seconds remaining in a tied game. runner a2 is tackled inbounds at the b23. b1 is injured and team b has already been charged with their 4th timeout for a prior injury. ruling: a’s ball, first-and-10 on b18. charge team b with their fifth team timeout which requires a five-yard penalty. set the play clock to 40 seconds, and the game clock starts on the ready. b1 is suspended for one play. a.r. 4.46 fifth timeout—team b—live ball foul by team a third-and-10 on b20, with 40 seconds remaining in a tied game. wideout a2 is not on the line of scrimmage at the snap, leaving only 6 offensive players on the line. qb a1 throws an incomplete pass, and b2 is injured on the play. team b has already been charged with their 4th timeout for a prior injury. ruling: fourth-and-5 on b15. these fouls do not offset; each are enforced separately. team b will likely decline the illegal formation foul, making it fourth-and-10. the fifth time out for an injury requires a 5-yard penalty against team b, which is assessed regardless of clock status. the play clock is set to 40 seconds. the game clock starts on the snap, because of the incomplete pass, as well as the illegal formation penalty. b2 must leave the game for one play, unless a timeout is called. note: a fourth or fifth injury timeout does not create an option for the other team to start the clock on the ready or the snap. by rule, after an excess timeout, the clock starts as if the excess timeout had not occurred, (unless the opponent calls a timeout). (4-3-2-c). attempt to conserve time after two-minute warning a.r. 4.47 false start second-and-5 on b15. the score is tied with 15 seconds remaining in the game and the game clock running. team a is set at the line of scrimmage and a3 false starts. quarterback a1 spikes the ball in front of him to stop the clock. team a has: (a) used its three timeouts; or (b) has one remaining timeout. rulings: (a) second-and-10 on b20. penalize five yards and run 10 seconds off the clock, because the false start by a3 stopped the game clock prior to the action of the quarterback. the clock starts on the ready-for-play signal. (b) second-and-10 on b20. penalize five yards, but if team a chooses, it can prevent the 10-second runoff by using its final timeout. the clock starts on the snap, if team a takes its last timeout. a.r. 4.48 false start—team b offside third-and-6 on b15. twenty-five seconds remain in the game and the clock is running. team a is set at the line of scrimmage with b1 still in the offensive backfield. a5’s false start kills the play. team a has already used its timeouts. 12 ruling: third-and-11 on b20. penalize only the false start. (7-4-2). there is a ten-second runoff, if team b chooses, in which case the clock starts on the ready-for-play signal. a.r. 4.49 twelve men in team a huddle second-and-5 on b15. fifty-five seconds remain in the first half and team a is behind in the score. team a has been hurrying to get off as many plays as possible during the drive, although they have been briefly huddling between plays. team a is flagged for 12 men in the offensive huddle. team a has used its three timeouts. ruling: second-and-10 on b20. run 10 seconds if team b chooses, if in the referee’s judgment team a was attempting to conserve time. there could be situations in which this would not be a 10-second runoff, if the team is not hurrying to get plays off and thereby not conserving time. a.r. 4.50 not all offensive players set before snap—clock running after two-minute warning second-and-10 on b35. the score is tied, the clock is running, and: (a) 50 seconds; or (b) 1:50 remains in the game. as team a hurries to the line, the ball is snapped before tailback a2 gets set. a1 gets sacked at the b41. team a has already used its three timeouts. rulings: (a) and (b) second-and-15 on b40. false start. run 10 seconds off the game clock, if team b chooses, and the clock starts on the ready-for-play signal. when all 11 offensive players do not get set simultaneously prior to the snap, and the game clock is running after the two-minute warning of the half, the illegal shift converts to a false start, and the play must be shut down immediately. if all 11 players get set, and then two players shift without resetting prior to the snap, it is a live ball foul for an illegal shift, and there is no runoff. a.r. 4.51 back fails to set before snap—clock stopped second-and-10 on b35. the score is tied, the clock is stopped due to an incomplete pass on the prior play. there are 50 seconds remaining in the game. as team a goes up to the line, the ball is snapped before tailback a2 gets set. team a has already used its three timeouts. a1’s pass falls incomplete. ruling: third-and-10 on b35 or second-and-15 on b40. since the clock was stopped at the snap, the “conserving time rules” are not in effect. it is an illegal shift, rather than a false start, because the clock was not running, so the foul does not prevent the snap. the clock starts on the snap for the next play. a.r. 4.52 players moving at the snap third-and-10 on b30. with the clock running any time during the game, all members of the offense get fully set for one second, but as the ball is snapped: (a) left guard a2, (b) tight end a3, (c) wingback a5, (d) or tailback a6, is going from a two-point stance to a three-point stance, or is rolling forward, when the ball is snapped; or when the ball is snapped, (e) wide receiver a4, after coming set, is moving from off the line of scrimmage up to the line of scrimmage, or from on the line of scrimmage to off the line of scrimmage, (not an abrupt motion), or (f) wide receiver a4 is clearly off the line of scrimmage and moves forward to a position that is still clearly off the line of scrimmage. a1’s pass falls incomplete. rulings: (a), (b), (c), (d), (e): third-and-15 on b35. false start. if it occurs after the two-minute warning of either half, there is also the potential for a 10-second runoff. (f) fourth-and-10 on b30, or third-and-15 on b35. illegal motion. (7-4-8) a.r. 4.53 illegal formation—no 10-second runoff second-and-3 on b42. fifty seconds remain in the game. team a is in a hurry-up offense. the ball is snapped and the runner is downed on the b15. team a had only six men on the line of scrimmage, but all 11 players were in close proximity to the line of scrimmage. ruling: second-and-8 on b47. no 10-second runoff since a’s penalty did not prevent the snap. the clock starts on the snap. a.r. 4.54 delay of game by team a—after two-minute warning third-and-10 on b45. fifty seconds remain in the game and team a is behind in the score. a1 gets confused on what play to call and team a is called for delay of game. ruling: third-and-15 on 50. there is no 10-second runoff, because team a is not attempting to conserve time. the clock starts on the snap. a.r. 4.55 illegal shift/motion—team b offside—after two-minute warning second-and-10 on b35. with 0:50 remaining in a tied game, team a is in a hurry-up offense and b1 is set and lined up offside. (a) back a2 never gets set before the ball is snapped; or (b) back a2 gets set but then goes in motion and is moving toward the line of scrimmage at the snap. qb a1 spikes the ball. rulings: (a) second-and-15 on b40. ten-second runoff. the illegal shift converts to a false start, and the play is blown dead immediately after the snap. there is no foul for offside, since there was no legal snap. (b) second-and-10 on b35. let the play go through, and the penalties offset. a.r. 4.56 backward pass out of bounds—after two-minute warning third-and-8 on b28. a1 runs to the b20 and sees he is about to be tackled, so he throws the ball backward toward the sideline with no teammate in position to catch the pass. the ball hits b2 and rolls out of bounds at the b15. there was 1:20 left in the fourth quarter when the ball was snapped. 13 ruling: third-and-5 on b25. since the ball went out of bounds (spot of the foul) in advance of the spot of the backward pass (the basic spot), enforce from the spot of the backward pass (rule 8-7-7). ten seconds would also be run off the clock, if the defense so chooses, and wind the clock. if a foul for conserving time or 10-second runoff is declined, the game clock will start on the snap. a.r. 4.57 backward pass out of bounds—after two-minute warning third-and-10 on b30. fifty seconds remain in a tied game, and team a is out of timeouts, a1 runs the ball to the b14 where he throws a backward pass out of bounds. the ball goes out of bounds at the b21. ruling: option for team b: fourth-and-1 on b21, clock starts on snap (penalty is declined, therefore no runoff), or third-and-6 on b26 with a 10-second runoff, if b elects, and the clock starts on the ready-for-play signal. the penalty is enforced from the out of bounds spot (the spot of the foul) because it is behind the spot of the backward pass (the basic spot). this is a three-and-one enforcement. rule 8-7-7. a.r. 4.58 backward pass out of bounds—after two-minute warning second-and-20 on 50. with 1:30 remaining in the fourth quarter, a1 scrambles, and while at the a40, throws the ball backward and out of bounds at the a35. team a has already used its three timeouts. ruling: option for team b: third-and-35 on a35. the penalty is declined, so there is no 10-second runoff, (and the clock is on the snap); or second-and-25 on a45 with a 10-second runoff, if b elects, and wind the clock. this is a three-and-one enforcement (rule 8-7-7). if either the spot of the backward pass (basic spot) or the spot where the ball went out of bounds (spot of the foul) is behind the line of scrimmage, the foul is enforced from the previous spot (rule 14-3-6). a.r. 4.59 team b throws ball out of bounds after interception third-and-10 on b45. twenty-five seconds remain in a tied game. a1’s pass is intercepted by b2 at the b30. as b2 returns the interception, he sees that time is about to expire, so when he is at the a25, he throws a forward pass out of bounds to stop the clock with 12 seconds left. ruling: b’s ball, first-and-10 on a30. this is an illegal forward pass which requires a 5-yard penalty from the spot of the pass. there is no 10-second runoff, as the change of possession results in a stopped clock. this is not an illegal action to conserve time. the clock starts on the snap. a.r. 4.60 intentional grounding—after two-minute warning third-and-20 on 50. there is 1:35 remaining in a tied game, and team a is out of timeouts. a1 drops back to pass, and at the a35 intentionally grounds the pass to avoid a sack. ruling: fourth-and-35 on a35. team b has the option of accepting the foul and declining the 10-second runoff, or accepting the foul and the 10-second runoff as would be the normal enforcement. if the runoff is declined, the game clock starts on the snap. if it is accepted, the game clock will start on the ready-for-play signal. note: it is never possible to decline a foul and still have a 10-second runoff. a.r. 4.61 intentional grounding—inside of two minutes—additional foul on play third-and-10 on b20. 2nd quarter 1:45. qba1 is going to be sacked at the b31 in the pocket so he throws the ball into the ground with no eligible receiver in the area. a3 dragged down b3 during the play (1:38). ruling: a’s ball, fourth-and-21 on b31. loss of down for ing, but there is no 10-second runoff, and the game clock will start on the snap. because the additional foul for offensive holding would result in the clock starting on the snap regardless of whether it is accepted or declined, there is no 10-second runoff for the intentional grounding, or any other illegal act that conserves time. a.r. 4.62 intentional grounding—interception after two-minute warning third-and-10 on b45. the score is tied with 1:05 in the fourth quarter. a1 is pressured in the pocket at the a43, and to avoid a sack, throws the ball deep down the left side. there are no eligible a players in the area, although b1 intercepts at the b2 and runs out of bounds there with 0:45 on the clock. team a is out of timeouts. ruling: b’s ball, first-and-10 on b2. the clock is at 0:45 and would start on the snap. or, a’s ball, fourth-and-22 on a43. run 10 seconds if b chooses. set the game clock to 0:35 and wind. note: to keep the ball, team b would have to decline the penalty. a.r. 4.63 safety—intentional grounding—no 10-second runoff third-and-10 on a8. thirteen seconds remain in the game and team a trails 17-14. qb a1 backpedals into his end zone, and from the pocket, throws the ball into an area with no eligible receiver. there are 8 seconds left on the game clock. ruling: safety. safety kick from the a20. there is no 10-second runoff because the foul results in a score. a.r. 4.64 illegal forward pass—after two-minute warning third-and-5 on b31. with 10 seconds remaining in the game, and team b ahead, qb a1 scrambles to his right and throws a pass toward end a2 who is in the end zone. the pass is deflected by b1 and falls incomplete. the ball was thrown from the: (a) b30; (b) b32 after a1 had advanced to the b30 and returned behind the line of scrimmage; or (c) b32 after first throwing a pass from the b36 that b3 deflected back to a1, who caught the ball at the b36 and scrambled to the b32. rulings: in (a), (b), and (c), 10-second runoff; game over. 14 note: after the two-minute warning of either half, an illegal pass is considered illegally conserving time, and a 10-second runoff is an option. a.r. 4.65 fouling intentionally to stop clock—after two-minute warning there are twelve seconds remaining in the game, and team a is out of timeouts and trails by one point. a1 catches a long pass and is downed at the b12 with four seconds remaining on the clock. a1, realizing that time is about to expire: (a) punches b2; or (b) takes his helmet off (not as part of an injury). rulings: (a) unnecessary roughness a1. ten-second runoff. game over.

(team b could choose to decline the runoff and start the clock on the snap.) (b) third-and-5 on b25. set the play clock to 40 seconds and start the game clock on the ready if team a chooses. team b has intentionally fouled after the two-minute warning, stopping the clock. a.r. 4.68 second timeout in same dead ball period under two minutes third-and-10 on b40. with 1:30 remaining in a tied game, a2 takes a handoff and runs to the b31. after official’s measure, team a is short of the line-to-gain and team a calls its first timeout of the half (1:20). as team a lines up in a scrimmage formation, team b calls its first timeout. as both teams line up after team b’s timeout, qba1 realizes that there are only 10 players on offense and signals for a timeout, which the umpire grants. ruling: a’s ball, fourth-and-6 on b36. delay of game and team a is charged its second timeout of the half. when a second timeout in the same dead ball period is erroneously granted, there is a 5-yard penalty, and the timeout is also charged. there is no 10-second runoff because the clock was stopped. extension of periods a.r. 4.69 too many team a players on field on punt—last play of half fourth-and-5 on a25. team a is leading 21-17 with three seconds remaining in the game. team a lines up in punt formation with 12 players on the field. a1 punts the ball to b1 at the b30 who returns it to the a40. time runs out. ruling: b 1-10-a35, extend for an untimed down. the officials should shut this play down before the snap and enforce 5 yards, (no 10 second runoff). but because the officials let the play go on, the penalty is enforced as a foul during the down. since this foul by the kicking team on a punt can be enforced from the end of the play, the period is extended if team b so chooses. a.r. 4.70 offensive foul on punt—first touch—last play of half fourth-and-10 on a30. with eight seconds remaining in the game and team b down by one point, team a lines up to punt. team b rushes 11 players, but a1 gets off a good punt to the b10 where a2 downs it. just after the snap, a3 head-slaps b2. time expires on the play. ruling: b’s ball, first-and-10 on b25. enforce the personal foul from the dead ball spot, and extend for an untimed down. even without the head slap, the half could be extended from the b10 due to the first touch by a2. a.r. 4.71 offensive foul on missed field-goal —last play fourth-and-10 on b30. on the last play in the 4th quarter of a tied game, a1 attempts a field goal from the b38. a2 and a3 illegally chop block b1 on the play. the field-goal attempt is short and: (a) hits in the end zone or goes through the back of the end zone; or (b) is caught by b2 in the end zone or field of play and returned to the b40. rulings: (a) b’s ball, first-and-ten on a47. extend for an untimed down. unr and uns fouls can be carried over on missed field goals, which would allow an extension. if the foul had not been a unr or uns, there would be no option to extend and the game would go to overtime. (b) b’s ball, first-and-ten on a45. extend for an untimed down. the rationale is the same as above. 15 a.r. 4.72 offensive foul prior to interception—last play third-and-10 on 50. the score is tied with three seconds left in the first half. a1 drops back to pass, and as b1 rushes the passer, tackle a2 puts his hand on b1’s facemask and: (a) continues to push b1’s head back without grasping the mask; or (b) twists b1’s facemask. a1 then throws a pass which is intercepted by b2 and returned to the a16. rulings: (a) half over. the illegal hands penalty by a2 is not carried over, so there is no opportunity for an extension. (b) b’s ball, first-and-goal on a8. extend for an untimed down, since the facemask is a personal foul, so it is carried over and enforced from the dead ball spot. a.r. 4.73 offensive foul prior to punt and change of possession—last play of half fourth-and-10 on a40. with 0:10 remaining in the first half, a1’s punt is caught by b1 at the b15 and returned to the b30, where he fumbles. a2 recovers the loose ball at the b35, and time expires on the play. team a was in an illegal formation at the snap. ruling: half over. the foul for illegal formation can only be enforced at the previous spot with team a still in possession, so there is no extension. if team b had possession at the end of the down, the foul could be enforced from the dead-ball spot and team b could elect to extend the period for an untimed down. a.r. 4.74 double foul—interception—last play of quarter or half first-and-10 on 50. a1 is illegally in motion. b1 is offside at the snap. b2 intercepts the pass and is downed on the b40. on the play, time expires in the: (a) first quarter; or (b) either half. rulings: (a) a’s ball, first-and-10 on 50. quarter over. replay the down to begin the second quarter. the 1st or 3rd quarters are not extended when there are double fouls.

(b) a’s ball first-and-15 on b25. illegal formation as a3 is not aligned in the normal five ineligible player core. 20 substitutions a.r. 5.12 must participate at reported position on a try for point from the b15, team a lines up in a “swinging gate” formation with the center #67, who had reported as eligible, on the end of the line. before the snap, team a shifts to a normal formation with center #67 in the middle of the line, and successfully kicks the try. ruling: re-try kick on b20 or 2-point try on b7. when #67 reports as eligible, he must participate in an eligible position. the shift puts him in an ineligible position, which creates an illegal formation. a.r. 5.13 player leaves field on opponent’s sideline or end line third-and-12 on a40. a1 scrambles and gains five yards. at the end of the down, it is discovered that: (a) withdrawn offensive player a2 had cleared the field on the opponents’ sideline or over the end line; or (b) withdrawn defensive player b1 had cleared the field on the opponents’ sideline or over the end line. rulings: (a) option: third-and-17 on a35, or fourth-and-7 on a45. live-ball foul enforced at the previous spot. (5-2-6) (b) third-and-7 on a45. live-ball foul enforced at the previous spot. (5-2-6) note: the penalty for leaving the field on the opponent’s sideline is a live ball foul that occurs at the snap and thus penalized from the previous spot. therefore, a team could call a timeout before the snap to save themselves from the penalty. (5-2-8-(e)) a.r. 5.14 substitution after snap—interference with play third-and-14 on a35. team b makes a situational substitution sending four players into the game, however five players leave the field. following the snap, b11 realizes he should be in the game and re-enters the field of play. shortly after b11 enters the game, a1 passes into b11’s area, and b11 breaks up the pass at the 50-yard line. ruling: first-and-10 on 50, or whatever result the crew determines to be appropriate. palpably unfair act. note: since b11 entered the field and had an immediate effect on the play, it is a palpably unfair act. if b11 had covered a different receiver and had not had a direct and immediate effect on the play, a five-yard penalty for illegal substitution would be enforced from the previous spot. a.r. 5.15 substitute enters field before snap—offense third-and-3 on a40. the offense has 10 players on the field. prior to the snap, a11 (who had not participated in the previous play) enters the field to participate in the play and: (a) enters past the numbers and sets in a legal position for one second before the snap; (b) stays in motion backward as the ball is snapped, and he is behind the tight end at the snap. a2 runs to the a45. rulings: (a) a’s ball, first-and-10 on a45. legal play if team a has seven players on the line of scrimmage. (b) third-and-8 on a35. illegal shift. this would convert to a false start after the two-minute warning of a half and create the potential for a 10-second runoff. (7-4-6). in either (a) or (b), if this occurs before the two-minute warning, the umpire should hold up play until the defense has the opportunity to match up. a.r. 5.16 substitute enters field before/after snap—defense third-and-3 on a35. the defense has 10 players on the field prior to the snap: (a) just prior to the snap, b11 enters the field, onside, and makes the tackle on runner a3 at the a37; (b) b11 enters the field just after the ball is snapped, and after the play develops, b11 tackles a3 at the a37; or (c) b11 enters the field well after the ball is snapped and immediately tackles a3 as he is running near the team b sideline at the a37. rulings: (a) fourth-and-1 on a37. legal play. (b) first-and-10 on a42. illegal substitution. (if the crew feels he entered the field so late that this is a palpably-unfair act, they could enforce whatever they feel is equitable). (c) first-and-10 on b48 (or whatever the crew deems equitable). palpably-unfair act. (12-3-3) a.r. 5.17 substitutes enter field on punt play—before possession fourth-and-10 on a30. a1’s punt is rolling at the b10. before b1 picks up the punt at the b10, substitutes from: (a) team a; (b) team b; or (c) both teams come on the field at the b35 thinking the play is over. b1 returns the ball to the 50. rulings: (a) b’s ball, first-and-10 on a45, or fourth-and-15 on a25. enforce the illegal substitution from the dead ball or previous spot; (b) b’s ball, first-and-10 on b5. the post-possession foul is enforced from the end of the kick. (c) b’s ball, first-and-10 on b5, or team b has the option to replay—fourth-and-10 on a30. this is a double foul with a change of possession. (14-5-2) a.r. 5.18 substitutes enter field on punt play—after possession fourth-and-10 on a30. a1’s punt is rolling at the b10. after b1 picks up the punt at the b10, substitutes from: (a) team a; (b) team b; or (c) both teams enter at the b35 thinking the play is over. b1 returns the ball to the 50. rulings: (a) b’s ball, first-and-10 on a45. enforcement is from the dead ball spot. 21 (b) b’s ball, first-and-10 on b30. enforcement is from the spot of the foul, since that is behind the dead ball spot. (14-4-3) (c) b’s ball, first-and-10 on b35. enforcement is a double foul after a change of possession, so the ball is placed at the spot team b’s foul, which is enforced as if it were the only foul on the play. in this case, that is the spot of b’s foul or the dead ball spot, whichever is least advantageous for team b. (14-5-2) a.r. 5.19 substitution by team a—quick snap—defense 12 players on field first-and-10 on b45. a1 substitutes and quickly snaps the ball without huddling. team b is caught with 12 men on the field, and illegal motion is called on a3. there are more than two minutes left in the half. ruling: a’s ball, first-and-10 on b45. play is voided by rule. no foul for 12 men on the field or illegal motion. warn the offense that a second violation of this rule at any point during the game will result in an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty. the game clock is reset to the time remaining when the snap occurred and will start on the next snap. note: the officials should prevent this from happening, by standing over the ball while team b “matches up.” if they do not stand over the ball and it is snapped, only personal fouls or unsportsmanlike conduct fouls would be enforced. a.r. 5.20 substitution—12 men in offensive huddle second-and-10 on b35. while team a is in the huddle, a12 enters the huddle. the player for whom a12 was substituting is confused and does not realize that he is to leave the field, and he remains in the huddle. ruling: second-and-15 on b40. illegal substitution, 12 men in the huddle. the referee blows the whistle immediately. a.r. 5.21 substitution—12 men in offensive huddle on kickoff after a score, team a lines up for a kickoff and huddles before the kickoff. there are 12 men in team a’s huddle. the twelfth man runs off the field: (a) before; or (b) after the back judge starts the play clock. the ball is kicked from the a35, and b2 fields the ball and is tackled at the b5. rulings: (a) b’s ball, first-and-10 on b5. there is no foul for 12 men in the huddle, since the play clock has not started. (b) kickoff a30. illegal substitution. the officials should kill the play before the kick. a.r. 5.22 substitution—player wearing ineligible number lines up in eligible position fourth-and-goal on b2. team a player number 99 enters the game and lines up at the tight end position. he does not report as an eligible player. a1 scores on the play. ruling: fourth-and goal on b7. illegal formation. numbers 90–99 are for ineligible players who must report if playing an eligible position.

(d) b’s ball first-and-10 on a27. interference with the opportunity to catch a kick. the ball belongs to team b at the a42 because it did not reach the a45 and team b did not touch the ball before recovery, so the penalty can be enforced from that spot. a.r. 6.9 onside kick—airborne control by team a—lands out of bounds a1 attempts an onside kick from the a35. the ball bounces and goes into the air. as the ball is airborne near the sideline at the a46, a2 jumps up and controls the ball there. before a2 comes to the ground, he is pushed out of bounds where he maintains control of the ball when he hits the ground. a2 would have landed inbounds. ruling: b’s ball, first-and-10 on a46. this is a kickoff out of bounds, because a2 did not complete the process of the catch inbounds. team b would take the ball at the dead ball spot, as it is more beneficial than 25 yards from the spot of the kick. a.r. 6.10 onside kick—block by team a within 10 yards on a grounded onside kick from the a35, a1 blocks b1 above the waist at the a43 while the ball is rolling at the a46. a2 falls on the ball at the a47. ruling: rekick a25. illegal block. kickers may not block an opponent in the first 10 yards until the ball has been touched by a team b player, unless that player is actively trying to obstruct him. the location of the ball at the time of the block is irrelevant. team b must accept the penalty and have a rekick, or the ball would belong to team a, because team a is in legal possession at the end of the down. a.r. 6.11 onside kick—block by team a—beyond 10 yards on a grounded onside kick from the a35, a2 falls on the ball at the a47. while the ball was rolling at the a44, a1 blocks b1 high at the a46. ruling: a’s ball, first-and-10 on a47. legal block and recovery. the block occurred beyond 10 yards after the ball hit the ground, thus the block was legal. note: in blocking on a free kick, the location of the ball is irrelevant. the key issues to the legality of the block are the location of the block, and whether the ball has hit the ground or has been legally touched. a.r. 6.12 onside kick—multiple fouls by team a on an onside kick into the ground from the a35, a1 blocks b1 high at the a44 while the ball is at the a42. the ball goes out of bounds untouched at the a48. ruling: b’s ball, first-and-10 on a38. team b also has the option of a re-kick from the a25, but it would choose to enforce the illegal block foul from the dead-ball spot. the block is illegal, because team a blocked within the first 10 yards, before the ball was legally touched. a.r. 6.13 onside kick—ball batted backward by team b on an onside kick from the a35, the ball rolls toward the sideline at the a44 where b1 bats the ball backward to the b46 where it glances off of a2’s leg, and it goes out of bounds at the b38. ruling: b’s ball, first-and-10 on b38. no foul for a kickoff out of bounds, since a2 is deemed not to have touched the ball. it is a legal bat, because the ball was batted backward. a.r. 6.14 onside kick—team a illegal formation on an onside kick from the a35, a3 is moving his feet forward before the kick but is not offside. a4 then recovers the kick at the a47. ruling: rekick from a30, after the five-yard illegal formation penalty for a3 not keeping both feet on the ground from the time the kicker starts forward until the ball is kicked. 24 a.r. 6.15 onside kick—last touched by team a before going out of bounds on a grounded onside kick from the a35, the ball is touched by b2 at the a43 and muffed to the a44 where a2 then muffs it causing the ball to go out of bounds at the b48. ruling: b’s ball, first-and-10 on b48. team b would decline the foul for a kickoff out of bounds, unless the ball went out of bounds more than 25 yards from the spot of the kick. a.r. 6.16 onside kick—double and multiple fouls on an onside kick from the a35, the ball rolls to the a43 where a1 muffs it, and the ball rolls out of bounds at the a44. after a1 muffed the ball, and before it went out of bounds, b2 blocked a3 below the waist at the a42. ruling: rekick a35. illegal touch and kickoff out of bounds by team a; low block by team b. it is not a 5 vs. 15 enforcement, because neither the illegal touch nor the kick-off out of bounds are simple five-yard penalties, and because there was a change of possession on the play. a.r. 6.17 onside kick—double foul—kickoff out of bounds/clip on an onside kick from the a35, the ball goes out of bounds at the a48. b1 clips while the ball is rolling toward the sideline. ruling: re-kick a35. the kickoff out of bounds and clipping offset. it is not a 5 vs.15 enforcement, as the result of the play is a change of possession, and because a kickoff out of bounds is not a simple five-yard penalty. a.r. 6.18 onside kick—legal recovery by team a—double foul on an onside kick from the a35, a2 is offside. a1 recovers at the a47, and b1 tackles a1 by the facemask. ruling: rekick 50. double foul (5 vs. 15) applies, as there was no change of possession. enforce b’s foul from the previous spot and rekick. a.r. 6.19 onside kick—double foul—illegal touch/low block on an onside kick from the a35, a1 is the first to touch the kick at the a42, and a2 then recovers the kick at the a46. during the kick, b1 blocks a3 below the waist at the a44. ruling: rekick at the a35. this is not a 5 vs. 15 enforcement, because the illegal touch is not a simple five-yard penalty. free kick—ball going out of bounds a.r. 6.20 kickoff out of bounds—last touched by team b on a kickoff from the a35, the ball rolls out of bounds at the b12 after first touching a1 and then b1. ruling: b’s ball, first-and-10 on b12. the receiving team last touched the ball, and a1’s touch was legal. a.r. 6.21 safety kick out of bounds—last touched by team a a1 free kicks from the a20 following a safety. the kick is muffed at the b40 by b1, is touched by a3, and it then rolls out of bounds at the b35. ruling: b’s ball, first-and-10 on 50. if a safety kick goes out of bounds (untouched or last touched by a), the ball is placed at the out of bounds spot or 30 yards from the spot of the kick, whichever is better for team b. a.r. 6.22 onside kick out of bounds on kickoff from b35 b1 commits a personal foul on a touchdown run by a1, and then during the subsequent successful try, b2 also commits a personal foul. team a elects to have both personal fouls enforced on the kickoff. on the ensuing kickoff from the b35, (30 penalty yards), a attempts an onside kick, but the ball goes out of bounds, untouched, at the b8. ruling: b’s ball, first-and-10 on b10. the penalty for a kickoff out of bounds is 25 yards from the spot of the kick, not a 25-yard penalty. thus, there is no option to go “half the distance to the goal” and give b the ball at the b17½. free kick—ball into receiver’s end zone a.r. 6.23 kick into end zone—fumbled into field of play on a kickoff from the a35, b1 catches the ball in the end zone and fumbles after he starts to run. the ball rolls out to the b4 where b2 falls on the ball. the game clock did not run on the play. there is: (a) 3:22;

(b) b’s ball, first-and-10 on b9. when the illegal wedge (or illegal double-team) occurs during the return, enforcement is normal enforcement on a running play, (spot of the foul or dead ball spot). (c) b’s ball, first-and-10 on b11. on a touchback, an illegal wedge is penalized 15 yards from the spot where the players formed the wedge. note: if two or more players intentionally align shoulder-to-shoulder within two yards of each other and move forward together, it is an illegal wedge at that point; actual contact with an opponent is not necessary. additionally, if two or more players, at least one of whom did not start in the set-up zone, block and make contact with an opponent at the same time, it is an illegal double-team block. if the foul occurs during the kick, enforcement is from the spot of the foul. if the foul occurs during the return, the penalty is enforced as a foul on a running play. if the foul occurs in the receiving team’s end zone during the kick, it is enforced from the previous spot. a.r. 6.33 kickoff—team b double team block on a kickoff from the a35, b3 is one of eight players in the setup zone at the time of the kick. after the kick is caught by b1, b3 double-team blocks (a) a2 at the b45, with teammate b4 who also was in the setup zone when the ball was kicked, or (b) a2 at the b30, with teammate b5 who originally lined up as one of 3 players positioned outside of the setup zone when the ball was kicked. b1 returns the kick to the b35. rulings: (a) b’s ball, first-and-ten on the b35. no foul for 2 players blocking an opponent together who were both in the setup zone at the time the ball is kicked. they may double-team block an opponent together, anywhere on the field, though they may not form a wedge. (b) b’s ball, first-and-ten on the b15. it is a foul for an illegal double team block if 2 or more players of the receiving team block an opponent together, if they weren’t both in the setup zone when the ball was kicked. the 15-yard penalty is enforced as a foul on a running play in this case, as it happened during the return. if it happened during the kick, it would be enforced from the spot of the foul. this is a personal foul. note: as described, (a) is a legal double team block, and (b) is an illegal double team block. in either case, had the two players come together, shoulder to shoulder, within two yards of each other, and moved forward together (with or without contacting an opponent), it would be an illegal wedge. enforcement is the same, but an illegal wedge is prohibited by any two team b players, while an illegal double team block is prohibited if one of the two players did not start in the setup zone. a.r. 6.34 kickoff—two team b players move forward to block - during/after the kick on a kickoff from the a35, b1 catches the kick at the b5 and is tackled at the b24. two team b players who were in the setup zone at the time of the kick intentionally come together shoulder to shoulder within 2 yards of each other at the b30 and move forward to block a3 (a) while the ball is in the air, or (b) after b1 begins running with the ball. rulings: (a) b’s ball, first-and-ten on b15. an illegal wedge is a spot foul if it occurs during the kick. this is a personal foul. (b) b’s ball first-and-ten on the b12. since the illegal wedge occurred during the return, the enforcement is normal enforcement on a running play - either the dead-ball spot as on this play, or the spot of the foul. this is a personal foul. note: a wedge block, (2 or more players), is illegal both during the kick and during the return on free kick plays, regardless of where the involved receiving team players were positioned at the time of the kick. a.r. 6.35 kickoff—team a player pushes team b player in back with kick in air on a kickoff from the a35, a2 runs downfield while the kick is in the air and pushes b4 in the back as he left the setup zone at the b48. a2 tackles return man b2 at the b15. ruling: b’s ball, first-and-ten on b25 or re-kick a25. it is illegal for a team a player on a kickoff to push a team b player in the back while the ball is in the air. miscellaneous free kick plays a.r. 6.36 kickoff—illegal bat by team a on a kickoff, the untouched ball bounces at the b10 and is airborne out over the sideline. a2 jumps from the field of play and bats the ball forward into the field of play. a3 recovers the ball at the b7 and advances to the b1. ruling: re-kick a25. illegal bat. no player may bat a kick toward his opponent’s goal line (even if he is attempting to keep the ball inbounds). 27 a.r. 6.37 fair catch interference on free kick—extension of period on a kickoff from the a35, b1 signals for a fair catch at the b22. a1, not seeing the signal, tackles b1 just after he touches the ball. the ball rolls to the b20 where a2 recovers. time for the half expired on the play. ruling: b’s ball, first-and-10 on b37. fair catch interference. extend the period for a fair-catch kick or a snap from scrimmage. if b1 had completed the catch and then a1 tackled him, the period could only be extended for a fair catch kick after the dead ball foul was enforced, or b could elect to not extend and have the foul enforced on the kickoff to start the second half. a.r. 6.38 delay of kickoff the back judge hands the ball to the kicker for a kickoff at the a35 and winds the 25-second play clock. the kicker does not begin to move towards the ball before the play clock hits zero. ruling: kickoff a30. delay of kickoff. note: if the kicker has started toward the ball before the play clock hits :00, delay of kickoff should not be called. a.r. 6.39 twelve men on the field at the time of ready-for-play signal team a lines up for a kickoff from the a35. the back judge starts the play clock, and officials then discover that team a has 12 men lined up for the kickoff. ruling: kickoff a30. too many men in the formation. if either team has more than 11 men in the formation with the play clock running, the officials should blow their whistles immediately and not allow the kick. a.r. 6.40 onside kick—double foul with a change on a grounded onside kick from the a35, a1 blocks b1 at the a43 while the ball is at the a44. b2 then recovers the ball at the a43 and returns it to the a20. during the return, b3 blocks a3 below the waist at the a30. ruling: b’s ball, first-and-10 on a45, or team b can choose to replay the down. this is a double foul with a change of possession. a1’s block is illegal because it occurred in the first 10 yards, and the ball had not been legally touched. the location of the ball when the block occurs is irrelevant. a.r. 6.41 safety kick—kicker goes out of bounds—team a recovery with 1:30 remaining in the game, a1 punts a safety kick from the a20. b1 signals for a fair catch at the b40 and muffs the ball, which rolls to the b46. a2 steps on the sideline at the 50, returns inbounds with both feet, pushes b1 in the back, and recovers the ball at the b46. ruling: a’s ball, first-and-10 on b46. as with a kickoff, a is eligible to touch/recover after it goes 10 yards. it is not a foul for a2 being out of bounds, because he isn’t avoiding a block. a2’s touching after being out of bounds is legal, because the kicked ball had been touched by an opponent. the push in the back is legal, as a2 is making a personal attempt to recover the ball, and the kick is no longer in flight. a.r. 6.42 kicker goes out of bounds—team a recovery on an onside kick from the a35, a2 touches the ball at the a46, and a2 then recovers the ball at the a44. a2 had stepped on the sideline at the a40 and then re-established inbounds before touching the ball. ruling: re-kick a30. on free kicks, a member of the kicking team who has been out of bounds cannot touch the kick until the ball has been touched by a member of the receiving team. the illegal touching foul cannot be enforced from the dead ball spot, because team a is in legal possession at the end of the down. the foul for illegal touching must be enforced from the previous spot. if a2 had stepped out of bounds to avoid a block, it would also be a foul for voluntarily going out of bounds. a.r. 6.43 kicking team offside on kickoff—kick out of bounds on a kickoff from the a35, a5 is offside. the kick goes out of bounds, untouched, at the b32. ruling: re-kick a30 for the offside, or b’s ball, first-and-10 on b40 for the kickoff out of bounds. note: the five-yard penalty for offside cannot be added on from the b40, because only one of the fouls, (kickoff out of bounds, and offside), can be enforced. it could be enforced from the out of bounds spot (b32), but the kickoff out of bounds enforcement is more beneficial. a.r. 6.44 kicking team offside on kickoff—kickoff out of bounds on a kickoff from the a35, the untouched kick goes out of bounds at the b38. a2 was offside. ruling: b’s ball, first-and-10 on b43. multiple fouls. the kickoff out of bounds foul is declined (b’s ball 25 yards from the spot of the kick), and the offside penalty is enforced from the dead-ball spot. team b also has the option to enforce the offside from the previous spot and re-kick, though they won’t likely take that option. a.r. 6.45 kickoff—illegal formation by team a on a kickoff from the a35, team a lines up with six players on one side of the ball, and four plus the kicker on the other side. as the kicker starts toward the ball, one of the players realizes he is on the wrong side and quickly runs in front of the kicker, so that when the ball is kicked, he is stationary on the a34-yard line, and there are five players on each side of the ball. b1 catches the ball at the b15 and returns it to the b30. ruling: re-kick a30, or b’s ball, first-and-10 on b35. illegal formation. the kicking team must be in a legal formation before the kicker begins approaching the ball. team b can enforce the foul from the previous spot or add the yardage to the dead ball spot. 28 a.r. 6.46 kickoff—illegal formation by team a on a’s kickoff from the a35, all members of team a have a foot on the a34 when the referee blows the ball ready for play, but after the ready, as the kicker is running forward to kick the ball, a3 motions parallel to the restraining line or loops backward in an attempt at a running start. he is at the a34 when the ball is kicked. the ball is kicked thru the end zone. ruling: re-kick a30, or b’s ball, first-and-10 on b30. this is a foul for illegal formation by the kicking team. kicking team members must remain in their position with one foot on the yard line behind the kicker’s restraining line, from the time the kicker approaches the ball, until the ball is kicked. a.r. 6.47 kickoff—double foul after change of possession a1’s kickoff from the a35 is caught by b1 at: (a) the b2; or (b) in b’s end zone. b1 returns the ball to the b45 where a1 tackles him by the facemask. during the return, b2 held a5 at the b30. rulings: (a) and (b) b’s ball, 1st-and-10 on the b30. this is a double foul after a change of possession. the fouls offset at the spot team b’s foul would be enforced if it were the only foul on the play. in this case, that is the spot of b’s foul or the dead ball spot, whichever is least advantageous for team b. a.r. 6.48 kickoff—double foul after change of possession a1’s kickoff from the a35 is caught by b1 at the b2. b1 returns the ball to the b40 where a1 tackles him by the facemask. during the return, b2 held a5 at: (a) the b30 or (b) the 50. rulings: (a) b’s ball, first-and-ten at the b30. this is a double foul after a change of possession, and the spot of team b’s foul is less advantageous for team b than the dead ball spot. (b) b’s ball, first-and-ten at the b40. the least advantageous spot for team b is the dead ball spot. a.r. 6.49 kickoff—batted by team b into team a player and ball goes out of bounds a1’s kickoff is bouncing near the sideline at the b25, b1 dives to recover the ball and bats it backward into a2 where it bounces off his leg and goes out of bounds at the b22. ruling: b’s ball, first-and 10 b22. this is a legal bat by b1, since it was backward, and a2 is deemed not to have touched the ball, since it was batted into him. it is therefore not a “kickoff out of bounds last touched by team a”. a.r. 6.50 kickoff a35—team b player leaves setup zone before kick on a kickoff from the a35, b3 is one of the 8 required team b players positioned between the a45 and the b40 (the “setup zone”). as the kicker approaches the ball, but before the ball is kicked, b3 steps to the b39 and continues toward his goal line to set up to block for the kickoff return. b1 catches the kick in the end zone and runs it out to the b30 where he is tackled. ruling: b’s ball, first-and-ten on b30 or a re-kick from the a40. illegal formation for team b not having at least 8 players in the setup zone at the time of the kick. a.r. 6.51 kickoff a35—team b player enters setup zone before kick on an onside kick from the a35, team b has nine players in the setup zone and player b3 is on the b39, just outside the setup zone. just before the ball is kicked, b3 steps on the b40-yard line. b1 recovers the onside kick at the a46. ruling: a’s ball, re-kick from the a40. illegal formation for team b having more than nine players in the setup zone at the time of the kick. a.r. 6.52 kickoff—team b player crosses restraining line before/after kick on a kickoff from the a35, b3 is one of the 8 (minimum) required team b players positioned between the a45 and the b40 (the “setup zone”). as the kicker approaches the ball, but (a) before the ball is kicked, b3 steps forward to the a44 or (b) after the ball is kicked deep, and before it is touched or hits the ground, b3 moves forward to the a43 and blocks a2. the kick lands in the end zone untouched. rulings: (a) b’s ball, first-and-ten on b25 or a re-kick from the a40. offside by team b for being beyond its restraining line when the ball is kicked. in this case, it would also be illegal formation for not having at least 8 players in the setup zone when the ball is kicked. (b) b’s ball, first-and-ten on b25 or a re-kick from the a45. illegal block by b3, (10-yard penalty), for blocking a kicking team player within 15 yards of team a’s restraining line, before the kick has been legally touched or hit the ground. the location of the ball at the time of the block is irrelevant. a.r. 6.53 kickoff—illegal formation/offside by team a on a kickoff from the a35, kicking team player a2 is lined up with his foot on the a34 yard line. as the kicker approaches the ball, a2 (a) begins chopping his feet in place; (b) takes a step forward to time the kick, but does not break the plane of the restraining line before the ball is kicked; (c) begins leaning forward to time the kick, and the heel of his back foot comes off the ground before the kick, but his toes remain on the ground, and he does not break the plane before the kick; or (d) has his feet stationary behind the 35 yard line, but he is leaning forward and his helmet breaks the plane of the 35 yard line just before the ball is kicked. the ball is kicked through the end zone. rulings: (a) b’s ball, first-and-ten on b30 or re-kick a30. illegal formation by team a. team a players must be stationary in their position from the time the kicker begins his approach until the ball is kicked. 29 (b) b’s ball, first-and-ten on b30 or re-kick a30. illegal formation. team a players must be stationary once the kicker begins his approach and may not move forward until the ball is kicked. (c) b’s ball, first-and-ten on b25. no foul. team a players must keep their feet on the ground once the kicker begins his approach, and until the ball is kicked, but they may lean forward prior to the ball being kicked. (d) b’s ball, first-and-10 on b30, or re-kick a30. team a’s restraining line is a plane, so this is offside by a2. a.r. 6.54 kickoff—legal formation by team a—holder on a’s kickoff from the a35, team a has five players to the right of the kicker, all standing within one yard of the restraining line, plus a holder kneeling while holding the ball. to the left of the kicker, team a has four players. on each side, there are two players, (other than the holder), outside the yard-line numbers and two players, (other than the holder), between the inbounds line and the yard-line numbers. kicker a1 kicks the ball through the end zone. ruling: b’s ball, first-and-10 on b25. legal formation. the holder counts toward either side as to the requirement of five players on each side of the kicker. in this case, he counts as the fifth team a player on the left-hand side, even though he is kneeling to the right of the kicker. the holder is never counted as one of the two players required to be between the inbounds line and the numbers. a.r. 6.55 kickoff—illegal formation by team a on a’s kickoff from the a35, team a has five players to the right of the kicker and five players to the left, all legally set. as the kicker approaches the ball, the wind blows the ball off the tee. team a brings a1, the widest man, from outside the yard-line numbers in to be the holder. this leaves team a with just one player outside the yard-line numbers on that side. the ball is kicked through the end zone. ruling: b’s ball, first-and-10 on b30 or re-kick a30. illegal formation. even though the holder counts toward either side for the purpose of five on each side, team a must still have two players outside the yard-line numbers and two players, (other than the holder), between the inbounds line and the yard-line numbers. a.r. 6.56 kickoff—legal/illegal formation by team a as the kicker approaches the ball on a kickoff from the a35, kicking team player a2 is lined up with his (a) hand on the a35 yard-line, in a three-point stance; (b) foot on the a35 yard-line in a two-point stance; (c) hand on the a34 yard-line, in a three-point stance; or (d) foot on the a34 yard-line, in a two-point stance. the ball is kicked through the end zone. rulings: (a) and (b): b’s ball, first-and-ten on b30 or re-kick a30. offside by team a. team a players may not be touching the restraining line when the ball is kicked.

(a) a2 briefly loses control of the ball when it hits the ground; or (b) a2 never loses control of the ball. (c) the ball moves slightly within control of a2 rulings: (a) third-and-5 on a35. incomplete pass. (b) first-and-10 on a40. the receiver never lost control of the ball, so this is a catch. (c) first-and -10 on a40. if the ball moves within control of the receiver, he is deemed not to have lost control of the ball, and it is a completed pass. if the receiver has to “chase” the ball, he is deemed to have lost control and the pass would be incomplete. a.r. 8.9 process of the catch—goal line—no football move first-and-10-on b25. a1 throws a pass to a2 who controls the ball and gets one foot and his right knee down, before he is contacted by b1. the contact by b1 sends him across the goal line and to the ground in the end zone. a2 makes no football move as he is going to the ground but the ball crosses the goal line. the ball comes out as he hits the ground in the end zone. ruling: second-and-10 on b25. incomplete. a2 did not perform, or have time to perform, a football move after getting his knee down, and he then lost control when he hit the ground. the fact that the ball crossed the goal line does not satisfy the requirements of a catch. had he maintained control of the ball when he hit the ground in the end zone, it would have been a completed pass at the spot of the ball at the time a2 was contacted, (with his knee down), by b1. a.r. 8.10 process of the catch—football move first-and-10-on b25. a1 throws a pass to a2 who controls the ball, gets both feet down, and then turns toward the goal line. he takes one more step and then dives into the end zone. when he lands in the end zone, the ball comes out. ruling: touchdown team a. kickoff a35. the pass is complete. the receiver had the ball long enough to become a runner prior to going to the ground, so he does not have to maintain control when he lands in the end zone. a.r. 8.11 process of the catch—football move first-and-10-on b25. a1 throws a pass to a2 who is contacted by a defender before he completes the catch at the three-yard line. despite b2’s contact, a2 keeps his balance, gets both feet down, tucks the ball, turns toward the goal line, and lunges into the end zone. the ball comes out as he hits the ground. ruling: touchdown team a. kickoff a35. the receiver had the ball long enough to become a runner prior to going to the ground, so he does not have to maintain control when he lands in the end zone. a.r. 8.12 process of the catch—football move—no defensive contact—receiver loses ball first-and-10 on the 50. a2 controls a pass in the air at the b40 with his left foot on the ground. he turns upfield as his second foot lands inbounds, and he reaches the ball forward to reach the line to gain. a2 is not contacted by any b player, and he loses the ball when he hits the ground at the b39. b3 recovers the ball and is tackled at the b38. ruling: b’s ball, first-and-10 on b38. a2 had completed the catch when he made a football move, and since he was not touched, he was not down by contact. 38 a.r. 8.13 incomplete pass—hops on same foot second-and-5 on a40. a pass is thrown to the sideline where a2 controls the ball with one foot inbounds and hops on the same foot inbounds prior to landing out of bounds. ruling: third-and-5 on a40. both feet did not touch inbounds. a.r. 8.14 incomplete pass—second step on player first-and-10 on b25. a2 jumps up to catch a pass at the b10 and comes down near the sideline. a2’s left foot lands on the ground, and his right foot comes down on b2 who is laying on the ground. a2’s next step is out of bounds. ruling: second-and-10 on b25. incomplete pass. a.r. 8.15 incomplete pass—rolls over on player—lands out of bounds first-and-10 on b25. a2 jumps up to catch a pass in the back of the end zone. he controls the ball in the air and comes down with only one foot on the ground in the end zone as b2 tackles him. a2 lands on top of b2 in the end zone, and in the process of being tackled, a2 rolls over on top of b2 and his arm then touches the end line. ruling: second-and-10 on b25. incomplete pass. a.r. 8.16 incomplete pass—player jumps from out of bounds second-and-10 on a40. in an effort to intercept a pass at the b45, b2, who is standing with one foot on the sideline and the other inbounds, jumps up in the air and gains control of the ball. b2 then comes down to the ground with both feet inbounds and carries the ball out of bounds at the b45. ruling: third-and-10 on a40. incomplete pass, as b2 is considered out of bounds when he touches the ball the first time. the play is dead when b2 first touches the pass. a.r. 8.17 process of the catch—ball touched by out of bounds player first-and-10 on b47. a4 controls a pass near the sideline at the b23 while airborne. b3 jumps from out of bounds and touches the ball in a4's hands before a4 gets his second foot to the ground. after a4 comes to the ground, he runs for a touchdown. (a) the ball was still loose when b3 touched it; or (b) the ball was held securely in a4’s hands throughout. rulings: (a) second-and-10 on b47. incomplete pass, because the ball was not in player control when it touched something that was out of bounds. (b) touchdown team a. kickoff a35. the touching by b3 does not put the ball out of bounds because it was in player control. note: the result is the same if this occurs in the end zone. a.r. 8.18 pass complete—ball touches pylon second-and-10 on b12. a4 controls a pass near the sideline at the b2-yard line with his left foot on the ground in bounds. as he is striding to take his second step, he reaches the ball out in his right hand and it hits the pylon. his right foot then hits the ground in bounds, and then the rest of his body lands in bounds in the end zone, where he maintains control of the ball. ruling: touchdown team a. kickoff a35. the ball touching the pylon does not put the ball out of bounds because it was in player control. a.r. 8.19 pass complete—foot touches pylon second-and-10 on b30. a1 throws a forward pass high to a2 near the sideline. a2 controls the ball in the air and gets one foot down inbounds. his second foot touches the pylon and then touches down in the end zone. ruling: touchdown team a. kickoff a35.

(b) a’s ball, fourth-and-9 on b39, incomplete pass. if the contact happens after his throwing motion begins, it is a forward pass if he passes the ball, regardless of the ball’s direction. a.r. 8.21 quarterback “tuck”— pass/fumble second-and-10 on a30. after quarterback a1’s hand has started forward in a passing motion, he sees his intended receiver is covered and attempts to bring the ball back to his body. the ball is knocked loose by b1 and recovered by b2 at the a25. the ball came loose: (a) before he started to tuck it back to his body; (b) as he was bringing it back to his body; or (c) was secured against a1’s body. rulings: (a) third-and-10 on a30. incomplete pass.

(3-22-4-item 3) a.r. 8.23 incomplete pass—airborne receiver forced out of bounds second-and-10 on b45. a1 throws a pass to a2 near the sideline. a2 goes high to catch the pass, secures possession while in the air, but is then pushed by b1 causing one of a2’s feet to come down on the sideline. b1 does not play the ball but instead pushes a2 with both hands on his waist. had he not been pushed, a2 would have come down inbounds with both feet at the b30. ruling: third-and-10 on b45. incomplete pass. a.r. 8.24 complete pass—receiver carried out of bounds second-and-10 on b45. a1 throws a pass to a2 near the sideline. a2 goes high to catch the pass, secures possession while in the air, and would have come down with both feet inbounds at the b30; however, b1 wraps him up while he is still in the air and carries a2 toward the sideline where he finally comes down out of bounds: (a) at the b28; or (b) at the b32. rulings: (a) first-and-10 on b28 (or where the ball crossed the sideline).

(b) a’s ball, second-and-10 on a20. incomplete pass. neither player completed the process of the catch inbounds. a.r. 8.29 not a simultaneous catch—control not simultaneous first-and-10 on a20. a2 controls a pass in the air at the a40. b3 then also gets control of the ball before they land. a2 and b3 fall down to the ground with both players controlling the ball. ruling: a’s ball, first-and-10

illegal, but when team a recovered the ball after team b touched it beyond the line, a new series of downs started for team a. it keeps the ball after enforcement. if team a recovers the ball beyond the line after it is touched by team b beyond the line, the ball would be dead. a.r. 8.35 illegal forward pass—complete—fumbled fourth-and-5 on a30. the punt is partially blocked by b1. the ball rolls

pass. b1 intercepts and runs for a touchdown. ruling: touchdown team b. kickoff b35. no foul by b1, as the pass was “not from scrimmage,” since the los went away when b2 touched the kick beyond the line. team b will decline the foul for a1’s illegal forward pass for throwing a forward pass after a change of possession. note: had the ball not been touched by team b beyond the line, and simply rolled back behind it on its own, in addition to an illegal forward pass by a1, this would also be defensive pass interference by b1, because the line of scrimmage would still exist. the fouls would offset, and the down would be replayed. a.r. 8.37 illegal forward pass from behind the line—defensive pass interference third-and-10 on a30. during a forward pass that was thrown after a1 had crossed the line and then returned behind it, b1 interferes with receiver a2 at the a45. the pass is complete to a2 who is tackled at the 50. ruling: third-and-10 on a30. illegal forward pass and defensive

chucked out of bounds—pass interference third-and-5 on b40. end a2 is illegally chucked out of bounds at the b30, immediately returns inbounds, and is interfered with by b2 at the b25, while the pass is in the air. b2 intercepts the ball and is tackled at the b40. ruling: a’s ball, first-and-10 on b25. since a2 was illegally contacted out of bounds, he is an eligible receiver as soon as he re-establishes, and this is defensive pass interference. decline the illegal contact penalty. a2 must make an immediate attempt to return inbounds in order to be eligible. a.r. 8.43 illegally chucked out of bounds—re-establishes—first to touch third-and-5 on b40. end a2 is illegally chucked out of bounds at the b30, immediately re-establishes inbounds, catches a pass at the b25, and runs for a

field of play from the end zone by a5, while he is contacting the ground in the end zone. b2 recovers at the b5 and runs to the b25. ruling: b’s ball, first-and-10 on b20. touchback. the ball is dead when it is touched by the team a player in the end zone, as it has not previously been touched by team b. 53 a.r. 9.21 team a first touches in field of play and ball goes out of bounds fourth-and-10 on a40. a4 touches the punt at the b5, and the ball then goes out of bounds at the b4. ruling: b’s ball, first-and-10 on b5, the spot of a’s first touching. a.r. 9.22 team a first touches in field of play and team b recovers fourth-and-10 on a40. a4 touches the punt in the field of play at the b10, and b2 recovers the ball at the b4. ruling: b’s ball, first-and-10 on b10, the spot of a’s first touching. a.r. 9.23 team a bats ball into end zone fourth-and-5 on a45. the punt hits on the b5 and bounces up and over the goal line. a2 jumps from the b2, and while airborne over the end zone, he bats the ball backward. the ball hits in the end zone and then rolls into the field of play where b1 picks it up, runs to the b30, fumbles, and a3 recovers. ruling: b’s ball, first-and-10 on b20. touchback. the ball is dead when it hits in the end zone, untouched by b. a.r. 9.24 team a bats ball from end zone out of bounds inside pylon fourth-and-5 on a45. the punt bounces from the field of play into the end zone but is still airborne and has not touched in the end zone. a1 leaps from the b1 and bats the ball back across the goal line. the batted ball crosses the goal line inside the pylon, crosses the sideline in flight at the b2, and first hits the ground out of bounds at the b3 (extended). ruling: b’s ball, first-and-10 on b2 (the spot where the ball crossed over the sideline prior to hitting out of bounds). the spot of the first touching is the b1 (the spot where a1 left his feet prior to batting the ball). a.r. 9.25 team a bats ball from end zone out of bounds outside pylon fourth-and-5 on a45. the punt bounces from the field of play into the end zone but is still airborne and has not touched in the end zone. a1 leaps from the b1 and bats the ball back across the goal line (extended). the batted ball crosses the sideline in the end zone (and the goal line extended, outside the pylon), and first hits the ground out of bounds at the b2 (extended). ruling: b’s ball, first-and-10 on b20. touchback since the ball was outside the pylon before hitting out of bounds. (11-6-1) first/illegal touching a.r. 9.26 first touch—last play of period fourth-and-16 on a8. on the last play of the half, punter a1 gets off a poor punt, and a2 first touches the ball at the a30. b1 picks it up and runs to the a4 where he fumbles and a3 recovers in the end zone. ruling: b’s ball, first-and-10 on a30. b may choose to extend the period at the spot of the first touch by a2, whether b1 fumbled or not. a.r. 9.27 first touch—recovery and fumble by team b fourth-and-5 on a30. a1’s punt bounces at the b48 and then is first touched by a2 at the b46. the ball rolls to the b40 where b1 picks it up and runs to the 50, fumbles, and a2 recovers. ruling: b’s ball, first-and-10 on b46, the spot of the first touch violation. a.r. 9.28 first touch—foul by team b during return—fumble fourth-and-10 on a48. a2 is the first to touch a1’s punt at the b14. the ball rolls to the b10, where b1 picks it up, runs to the 50, fumbles, and a3 recovers there. (a) during b1’s run, b2 clipped on the b40, or (b) b2 held on the b35. rulings: (a) a’s ball, first-and-10 on b35. the personal foul by b2 can be carried over the fumble and enforced from the dead ball spot, (personal foul prior to an interception, or prior to the recovery of a fumble or backward pass). the enforcement of that foul eliminates the spot of first touching. (b) b’s ball, first-and-10 on b14. when team a declines the team b holding foul, team b can take the ball at the spot of the first touching. if team a accepted the team b holding penalty, it would be enforced from the b35, resulting in b’s ball at the b25. a.r. 9.29 team b foul—batting/kicking ball into opponent—recovery by team a fourth-and-10 on b40. while the punt is in the air, b1 blocks a3 in the back or holds a3 at the b20. the punt lands at the b10 where, (a) a2 intentionally bats the ball backward into receiver b1, or (b) a2 kicks the ball into receiver b1. a3 then recovers at the b12. ruling: (a) b’s ball, first-and-10 on b6. since a2 batted the ball into b1, b1 is deemed not to have touched the kick, so it is team b’s ball at the end of the down. the post possession foul for holding or blocking in the back would be enforced from where the kick ended at the b12. (b) b’s ball, first-and-10 on b6, or fourth-and-10 on b40. this is a double foul with a change of possession. b1 is deemed not to have touched the ball, because it was kicked into him, so it is team b’s ball at the end of the down. the post possession foul for the holding or block in the back combines with the illegal kicking foul to create a double foul with a change of possession, which gives b the option of also replaying the down on a kick play. 54 a.r. 9.30 illegal touch—player from out of bounds fourth-and-10 on 50. a1’s punt is rolling, (a) at the b6, where a2 recovers and downs it; or (b) at the b4, where a2 recovers and downs it; or (c) at the b4, where it is recovered by a2 and carried into the end zone. a2 had been legally blocked out of bounds at the b40 but returned immediately inbounds. rulings: (a) fourth-and-15 on a45, or b’s ball, first-and-10 on b11. the illegal touching can be enforced from the previous spot or the dead ball spot. (b) fourth-and-15 on a45, or b’s ball, first-and-10 on b20. the illegal touching inside the five-yard line by a player who had been out of bounds gives team b the additional option of a touchback. (c) fourth-and-15 on a45, or b’s ball, first-and-10 on b25. the result of the play is a touchback, so the five-yard penalty can be tacked on from the b20. a.r. 9.31 first touch—player from out of bounds fourth-and-10 on 50. a1 punts the ball deep to b3 at the 10-yard line. b3 lets the ball go, and flyer a2 bats the ball at the b1 back to the b5. as the ball is rolling at the b5, a3 who had been legally blocked out of bounds, comes in and re-establishes himself, and then falls on the ball at the b5. ruling: b’s ball, first-and-10 on b5. team b takes the ball at the most advantageous spot of first touching. the touch by a3, while a first touch, is not a foul, because the ball has previously been touched by another player (a or b on scrimmage kick plays). a.r. 9.32 multiple illegal touch spots—player from out of bounds fourth-and-10 on 50. gunner a2 is legally blocked out of bounds as he covers the punt, but a2 re-establishes inbounds and is then the first to touch the rolling punt at the b16. the punt continues to roll toward the goal line untouched by anyone else, until a2 downs the ball on the b4. ruling: b’s ball, first-and-10 on b20, or fourth-and-15 on a45. multiple fouls by a2. team b can take the ball at the spot of the first illegal touch (b16), enforce the five-yard penalty from the dead-ball spot (also the spot of a2’s second touching), enforce the five-yard penalty at the previous spot and replay the down, or take a touchback due to the touching inside the 5-yard line. there is no option to enforce the five-yard penalty from the first illegal touch spot (b16), because that was not the dead-ball spot. a.r. 9.33 first touch—possession by team a—releases ball fourth-and-8 on b48. the punted ball comes down at the b4-yard line, where a2 catches it and his momentum carries him into the end zone; however, he releases the ball at the b1-yard line, but the ball rolls into the end zone. no team b player could have caught the ball. ruling: b’s ball, first-and-10 on b4. the play becomes dead as soon as a2 releases the ball in his possession. because he releases it prior to touching in the end zone with possession, team b will next snap at the spot a2 first touches the ball, which is also the dead ball spot in this case. it is irrelevant where the ball lands after he releases the ball. a.r. 9.34 first touch—no possession by team a fourth-and-8 on b48. a1 punts the ball high in the air. teammate a2 controls the airborne punt at the b15, takes two steps, and then loses control of the ball before establishing possession. the ball goes out of bounds through the end zone. ruling: b’s ball, first-and-10 on b20. a punted ball is dead when the kickers catch or recover a kick beyond the line of scrimmage (9-3-2). if a kicking team player loses control before completing possession (3-2-7), the ball remains loose. a.r. 9.35 multiple first touch spots—possession by team a—releases ball fourth-and-8 on b48. the punted ball is bouncing at the b8-yard line, where a2 tries to recover it in full stride, but muffs it toward the goal line. he then possesses it at the b4-yard line and his momentum carries him into the end zone; however, he releases the ball at the b1-yard line, and the ball rolls into the end zone. ruling: b’s ball, first-and-10 on b8. the play becomes dead as soon as a2 releases the ball in his possession. because he releases it prior to touching in the end zone with possession, the dead ball spot is where a2 first possesses it, the b4. team b will take the ball at the spot a2 first touches the ball, the b8. a.r. 9.36 first touch—team a player keeps teammate out of end zone fourth-and-4 on 50. a1 punts the ball and a2 and a3 run downfield to cover it before it goes into the end zone. a2 recovers the ball at the b4, and his momentum takes him toward the goal line. a3, while his foot is in the end zone, grabs his teammate a2 and prevents him from going into the end zone or touching the goal line. ruling: b’s ball, first-and-10 on b4. it is not a foul for a team a player preventing a teammate from carrying a punt into team b’s end zone. touchback—team a carries ball into end zone or touches ball in end zone a.r. 9.37 team a recovers ball and carries it into end zone fourth-and-10 on b40. after a punt, the ball bounces on the b8 and rolls to the b4, where a2 picks it up and runs the ball into the end zone. ruling: b’s ball, first-and-10 on b20. touchback. 55 a.r. 9.38 team a recovers ball and carries it into end zone—foul by a or b fourth-and-10 on a45. a1 first touches and recovers the punt on the b4 and carries it into the end zone. before a1 reaches the goal line: (a) a2 clips on b6; or (b) b1 clips on b6. rulings: (a) b’s ball, first-and-10 on b35. the clip is enforced from the succeeding spot, which is the b20. (b) b’s ball, first-and-10 on b3. spot of the clip is inside b’s 20-yard line so the penalty is enforced from the spot of the foul. impetus a.r. 9.39 impetus—team a blocks team b into ball fourth-and-10 on 50. the punted ball rolls to the b6. b1 steps aside and makes no attempt to field the ball. a2 blocks passive b1 into the ball, and the ball: (a) rolls over the end line; or (b) rolls to the b3 where a4 recovers. rulings: (a) b’s ball, first-and-10 on b20. touchback. the impetus is attributed to the block by a2. (b) b’s ball, first-and-10 on b3. a passive player blocked into a loose ball is deemed not to have touched it. note: if the punt is nearly at rest, and no team b player is attempting to recover it, the back judge should blow it dead. if the ball is still alive, though, and a player blocks a passive opponent into the ball, sending the ball into the end zone, the impetus changes from the kick, fumble, or backward pass, and the new impetus is attributed to the blocking player. furthermore, the touching by the passive opponent who was blocked into the ball is ignored. a.r. 9.40 team a impetus—b bats kick in end zone fourth-and-5 on b45. a’s punt is muffed at the b8 by b1 (no new impetus). the punt goes into b’s end zone, where there is a scramble for the ball. b2 bats the ball in the end zone backward over the end line. ruling: b’s ball, first-and-10 on b10. illegal bat, but since a’s impetus put the ball in the end zone, and team b did not run with the ball, enforcement is from b’s 20-yard line. this is a post-possession foul, and the end of the kick is the touchback spot. post-possession a.r. 9.41 post-possession foul in team b end zone—no return fourth-and-3 on a45. a1’s punt is muffed by b1 at the b5 yard line, and as the ball continues to roll toward the sideline, b2 grabs a2 in the end zone, to prevent a2 from recovering the loose ball. (b2 is not making a personal attempt to recover.) the ball rolls out of bounds at the b2. ruling: b’s ball, first-and-10 on b1. since team b fouled in their end zone but did not run with the ball, the spot of the foul is deemed to be the b20. therefore, this post-possession foul is enforced from the end of the kick, (the b2), as that is the least advantageous spot for team b. a.r. 9.42 post-possession—team b foul in field of play—touchback fourth-and-8 on a40. a1 punts. during the punt, b2 blocks low at the b8. the punted ball goes over the end line. ruling: b’s ball, first-and-10 on b4. since there was no return, it is considered a touchback, and the penalty is enforced from the spot of b’s foul if that spot is inside the 20-yard line. (3-38) a.r. 9.43 post-possession—foul in team b end zone—team b return fourth-and-2 on b45. a1 punts, and b1 catches the ball on the b5 and returns to the b22. during the punt, b2 clips in the end zone. ruling: safety. safety kick b20. post-possession foul with a return. because team b ran with the ball and the foul occurred in the end zone, the enforcement is a safety. if team b had not run with the ball, enforcement would be from the end of the kick, to the b2½. a.r. 9.44 not post-possession—team a first touches but in possession at end of down fourth-and-5 on a20. b1 clips a2 at the b45 while the punt is in the air. the ball bounces and touches a1’s foot at the b36. b1 then muffs it, and a3 falls on the ball at the b30. ruling: a’s ball, first-and-10 on b15. since team b does not have possession of the ball at the end of the down, this is not a post-possession foul. because the opponent has possession of the ball at the end of the down, the clp can be enforced from the dead-ball spot, and enforcement of the foul negates the first touch violation. a.r. 9.45 team a fouls during kick—b touches punt—recovered by a fourth-and-16 on b38. b1 gives a valid fair-catch signal at the b8, steps aside, and the ball bounces at the b8, where it touches b1’s foot and rolls toward the sideline near the b2. a2 blocks b1 low, and a3 picks up the ball at the b2 and runs into the end zone. ruling: fourth-and-31 on a47. previous spot enforcement. if team b had not lost possession, the low block could also be enforced from the dead ball spot. a.r. 9.46 not post-possession—team b loses possession after the kick fourth-and-5 on a20. b1 blocks a2 below the waist at the b45 while the punt is in the air. the ball bounces and touches a1’s foot at the b36. b1 then recovers the ball and runs to the b40 where he fumbles and a3 falls on the ball. 56 ruling: a’s ball, first-and-10 on b25. since team b lost possession at some point after the kick, this is not a post-possession foul. because the opponent has possession at the end of the down, the lbl can be enforced from the dead-ball spot, and enforcement of the foul negates the first touch. a.r. 9.47 not post-possession—team b loses possession fourth-and-10 on b45. while the punt is in the air, b2 pulls a2 down by the facemask at the b20. b1 fields the punt at the b10, but he fumbles at the b26 where the ball is recovered by a3. ruling: a’s ball, first-and-10 on b13. this is not a post-possession foul, and the opponent has possession at the end of the down, so the fmm can be enforced from the dead-ball spot. a.r. 9.48 not post-possession—team b loses possession after the kick fourth-and-12 on a38. during the punt, b1 holds a1 at the b45. b2 fields the punt at the b10 and returns it to the b15 where he fumbles. a2 scoops up the ball there and runs to the b5 where he fumbles. b2 recovers and is ultimately tackled at the b45. ruling: a’s ball, fourth-and-2 on a48. this is not a post-possession foul, as team b lost possession at one point during the down. the ball is returned to team a, and the holding foul is a 10-yard penalty (with no automatic first down) because it occurred during a kick that went beyond the line (9-1-4(d)). scrimmage kick crosses line of scrimmage and returns behind line a.r. 9.49 punt over and back—touched by team b—recovered by team a fourth-and-12 on a20. b1 partially blocks the punt and the ball bounces to the a22 where b2 attempts to recover but muffs the ball to the a18 where a2 picks up the ball, runs, and is tackled at the a25. rulings: a’s ball, first-and-10 on a25. team b touched the ball beyond the line of scrimmage. a.r. 9.50 punt over and back—simultaneous recovery fourth-and-5 on 50. b1 partially blocks the punt. the ball rolls to the b48 where it hits b2’s leg and rolls back to the a48 where a1 and b1 fall on it. ruling: b’s ball, first-and-10 on a48. the simultaneous recovery of a legal kick by eligible opposing players belongs to the receivers. a.r. 9.51 punt over and back—untouched beyond line fourth-and-10 on a25. a1’s punt is partially blocked, hits on the a28, and then bounces back to the a22, untouched beyond the line. a2 recovers at the a22 and he: (a) is downed there; (b) runs with the ball to the a33; (c) runs with the ball to the a36; or (d) throws a pass from the a22, which is complete to a3 at the 50. rulings: (a) b’s ball, first-and-10 on a22. if team a recovers and does not advance, team b gets the ball at the spot of recovery. (b) b’s ball, first-and-10 on a33. if team a recovers and advances, but does not reach the line to gain, team b gets the ball at the dead ball spot. (c) a’s ball, first-and-10 on a36. if team a recovers and advances beyond the line to gain, a has a first down. (d) b’s ball, first-and-10 on a20. illegal pass, as the ball has been beyond the line. the penalty is five yards from the previous spot and a loss of down. a.r. 9.52 punt over and back—touched beyond line by team a fourth-and-8 on a15. a1’s punt is blocked and goes to the a17 where the ball deflects off a4’s leg and rolls to the a14. back a3 recovers the ball at the a13 and runs to the 50, where he fumbles the ball. b8 recovers the ball at the b48 and runs for a touchdown. ruling: touchdown team b. kickoff b35. if there was not an accepted penalty, or if team b lost possession during its run, it could still take the ball at the a17 due to the first touch by a4. a.r. 9.53 illegal formation by team a—blocked punt and forward pass fourth-and-9 on a10. team a is in an illegal formation at the snap. a1’s punt is partially blocked and goes to the a13 where it rebounds, untouched, to the a8. a1 recovers the loose ball at the a8 and throws a pass to a2 at the a15. a2 catches the ball and is tackled at the a16. ruling: b’s ball, first-and-goal on a5. illegal pass, as the ball has been beyond the line. the penalty is five yards from the previous spot and a loss of down. the penalty for illegal formation is declined. field goal crosses line of scrimmage and returns a.r. 9.54 field goal over and back—untouched beyond line fourth-and-10 on b25. a1’s field-goal attempt from the b33 is partially blocked, hits on the b22, and then bounces back to the b27, untouched by anyone beyond the line. the ball is recovered at the b27 and (a) a2 or b2 downs it there; (b) a2 runs with the ball to the b17; (c) a2 runs with the ball to the b14; d) a2 throws a pass from the b27, which is complete to a3 at the b10; or (e) b2 runs with the ball to the b31. rulings: (a) b’s ball, first-and-10 on b27. the kick ended behind the line of scrimmage, so there is no “spot of kick” option. (b) b’s ball, first-and-10 on b17. the kick ended behind the line of scrimmage, so there is no “spot of kick” option. since a2 legally advanced the untouched kick recovered behind the line, his advance is legal, and team b takes over on downs at the dead ball spot. 57 (c) a’s ball, first-and-10 on b14. the kick ended behind the line of scrimmage, so there is no “spot of kick” option. since a2 legally advanced the untouched kick recovered behind the line, his advance is legal. a2 reached the line to gain, so it is a first down for team a.

(c) b’s ball, first-and-10 on b10. the post possession foul is enforced from the end of the kick, the b20. see 9-1-4. a.r. 9.65 team a fouls during punt—double change of possession fourth-and-10 on 50. a2 pulls b2 down by the facemask as a1 punts the ball. the ball is fielded at the b10 by b1, who runs to the b20 where he fumbles. a2 recovers at the b20 and runs to the b15 where he fumbles. b2 recovers and is tackled at the b12. ruling: b’s ball, first-and-10 on b27, or fourth-and-25 on a35. because the opponent has possession at the end of the down, the fmm can be enforced from either the previous spot or the dead-ball spot. a.r. 9.66 punt touched by team a player out of bounds in end zone fourth-and-10 on 50. the punt is bouncing toward the pylon. a1 steps on the sideline at the b1 and then dives for the ball, which is still airborne one yard in the end zone and bats it back to the b2. a2 recovers and falls to the ground at the b3. ruling: b’s ball, first-and-10 on b20. touchback. the ball is dead at its most forward point at the time it is touched by someone or something that is out of bounds. since a1 did not re-establish inbounds, the ball is dead when a1 touches it. since the ball is in the end zone at that point, the ball is dead in the end zone, resulting in a touchback. this is not a foul for a1 being out of bounds voluntarily, because he was not attempting to avoid a block; and it is not an illegal touch, because a1 is still an out of bounds player. a.r. 9.67 team b substitutes enter field during punt play—multiple team b fouls fourth-and-10 on 50. a1 punts the ball to the b10 where b2 picks up the ball and returns it to the b40. (a) while the ball was rolling at the b10 (before b2 picked it up); or (b) during the return, substitutes from team b came onto the field at the b30, thinking the play was over, and then returned to the bench area without interfering in the play. during b2’s return, b3 blocks a4 in the back at the b26. rulings: (a) b’s ball, first-and-10 on b5. multiple fouls by team b. the illegal substitution would be a post-possession foul enforced from the b10 to the b5. the block in the back would be enforced from the b26 to the b16. (14-1-3) (b) b’s ball, first-and-10 on b16. multiple fouls by team b. the illegal substitution occurs during the return and would, therefore, be enforced from the spot of the foul (b30), five yards. the block in the back would be enforced from the b26. (14-1-3) a.r. 9.68 team a substitutes enter field during punt play—double fouls fourth-and-10 on 50. a1 punts the ball to the b10 where b2 picks up the ball and returns it to the b40. (a) while the ball was rolling loose at the b10 (before b2 picked it up); or (b) during the return, substitutes from team a came onto the field at the b35, thinking the play was over, and then returned to the bench area without interfering in the play. during b2’s return, b3 blocks a4 in the back at the b26. rulings: (a) b’s ball, first-and-10 on b16, or fourth-and-10 on 50. double foul with a change of possession. (14-5-2) (b) b’s ball, first-and-10 on b26. double foul after a change of possession. the enforcement spot for double fouls after a change of possession is the spot where b’s foul would be enforced if it was the only foul. here, that is the spot of b’s foul or the dead ball spot, whichever is least advantageous for team b. (14-5-2) a.r. 9.69 punt from beyond line fourth-and-10 on 50. punter a1 scrambles after a bad snap and runs to the b45 where he punts the ball out of bounds at the b25. 59 ruling: b’s ball, first-and-10 on b25, or fourth-and-15 on a45. this is a punt, even though it is from beyond the line, and it is therefore b’s ball at the dead-ball spot. all rules on scrimmage kicks apply. see 9-1-1, note (5). team a’s 10-yard penalty is a “spot foul” and can therefore only be enforced from the spot of the kick, with the down replayed. a.r. 9.70 punt—double foul after change of possession fourth-and-5 on a45. receiver b1 holds kicker a4 on the b30 during the punt. b2 catches the punt at the b10 and runs to the b45 where he is tackled. during the return, a3 trips b2 at the b40. ruling: b’s ball, first-and-10 on b10. double fouls after a change of possession are offset at the spot where b’s foul would be enforced if it was the only foul. here, since b1’s foul is a post possession foul, that enforcement spot, (and therefore where these double fouls offset), would be either the end of the kick or the spot of b’s foul, whichever is least advantageous for team b. (14-5-2) a.r. 9.71 kicking team player out of bounds during punt fourth-and-12 on a21. at the snap, a1, who is lined up wide on punt coverage, runs out of bounds untouched to avoid being blocked by b1 and b2. a1 returns to the field of play at the a26. b1 attempts to catch the punted ball at the b41 but muffs it, and the ball rolls to the b19 where b3 and a4 simultaneously recover the ball. ruling: fourth-and-17 on a16 or b’s ball, first-and-10 on b24. team b has the option to enforce the foul for a player illegally out of bounds on a kick at the previous spot or the dead ball spot. simultaneous possession of a kick belongs to team b. a.r. 9.72 kicking team player out of bounds during punt—returns inbounds fourth-and-10 on a40. during the punt, flyer a2 is blocked out of bounds at the a45 and he (a) begins to run at an angle to return inbounds just after being forced out and returns inbounds at the b45, or (b) does not immediately run at an angle but runs parallel to the sideline and then returns inbounds at the b45. b3 fair catches the kick at the b20. rulings: (a) b’s ball, first and ten on b20. no foul for not returning inbounds legally. (b) b’s ball, first-and-ten on b35 or a’s ball fourth-and-25 on a25. unsportsmanlike conduct for not returning inbounds as quickly as is reasonable after being blocked out of bounds. a.r. 9.73 kicking team player out of bounds during punt—forced out fourth-and-7 on a31. a1, who is attempting to cover the punt, is contacted and forced out of bounds by b3 at the a34. a1 begins to immediately run at an angle and returns to the field of play at the a39. b2 signals for and makes a fair catch at the b39. ruling: b’s ball, first-and-10 on b39. contact by b3 is what caused a1 to run out of bounds and he immediately began to return at an angle, so there is no foul for a player out of bounds on a kick or for unsportsmanlike conduct. a.r. 9.74 blocking out of bounds during punt/during return fourth-and-10 on a40. a1’s punt is fielded by b1 at the b10 and returned to the 50. b2 blocks a2 causing a2 to go out of bounds, and b3 then immediately goes out of bounds and blocks a2 again at the b40 while they are both out of bounds. the block by b3 occurs (a) during the kick; or (b) during the return. rulings: (a) b’s ball, first-and-10 on b5. it is unnecessary roughness to go out of bounds to block an opponent during a punt. this is a post-possession foul. (b) b’s ball, first-and-10 on 50. no foul. this action did not happen during the punt. (12-2-8-c) a.r. 9.75 touchback—double foul with change of possession fourth-and-3 on b36. during the punt, b2 clips a2 at the b16. the ball lands at the b6 and a3 bats the ball at the b4 into the end zone where b2 recovers the ball and runs for a touchdown. team a had six players on the line of scrimmage. ruling: fourth-and-3 on b36, or b’s ball, first-and-10 on b8. this is a double foul with a change of possession. both the illegal formation and illegal bat fouls by team a were before the change of possession, and the clipping foul by team b was a post possession foul. the ball was dead when it hit in the end zone, (untouched by b), so the result of the play is a touchback. enforcement of b2’s foul is from the spot of the foul, since it is behind the end of the kick (b20). because this is a kick play, team b also has the option to require a replay of the down. a.r. 9.76 ball touches official inbounds during scrimmage kick fourth-and-5 on a45. a1 punts the ball to the b2 where it bounces and hits the back judge who was straddling the goal line. the ball bounces back to the b2 where it is downed by a2. if the ball had not struck the official, it would have gone into the end zone. ruling: b’s ball, first-and-10 on b2. if the ball touches an official who is inbounds, the touching is ignored. (7-2-2) a.r. 9.77 team a first touches and team b illegally kicks punt fourth-and-10 on 50. a1’s punt is first touched by a2 on the b2. the ball then bounces to the b6 where b5 kicks it into and out of the back of the end zone. ruling: safety. safety kick a20. the illegal kick is a post-possession foul, which is enforced from the spot of the foul or the end of the kick, whichever is least beneficial to the receiving team. because team b’s impetus caused the ball to go through the end zone, enforcement from the end of the kick results in a safety. the first touch violation is nullified by the accepted penalty. 60 a.r. 9.78 blocked punt—illegally kicked ball fourth-and-10 on 50. a1’s punt is blocked at the a40, and the ball rolls loose on the ground at the a47, when a1 kicks it downfield. the ball hits b1 at the b45 and bounces out of bounds (a) at the b45 or (b) at the a45. rulings: (a) b’s ball, first-and-10 on a40. illegally kicking the ball during a loose ball behind the line of scrimmage is enforced from the previous spot with a loss of down. (option to enforce from the dead ball spot) (b) b’s ball, first-and-10 on a35. because the ball was punted, and because it was b’s ball at the end of the punt play, the yardage can be enforced from the dead ball spot. a.r. 9.79 punt—illegal touch fourth-and-4 on a45. during the punt, flyer a2 inadvertently steps on the sideline at the b30, (not making an effort to avoid a player and not blocked out), as he is running downfield to cover the punt. he continues to run, immediately taking an angle and re-establishing himself in bounds, and falls on the ball (a) at the b5; or (b) at the b2. rulings: (a) fourth-and-9 on a40 or b’s ball, first-and-10 on b10. illegal touch by a2. no kicking team player, who has been out of bounds, may touch or recover a punt beyond the line until it has been touched by another player from either team. if a punt team player goes out of bounds on his own to avoid a block, it is a foul. if he steps out inadvertently, it is not a foul for going out of bounds, but he still cannot be the first to touch the kick. (b) fourth-and-9 on a40, or b’s ball, first-and-10 on b20. the foul for illegal touching after having been out of bounds, if accepted, has a touchback option, as the touching occurred inside the five-yard line. a.r. 9.80 punt—multiple fouls team a—illegal touch and pop fourth-and-10 on 50. a1’s punt is at the b17 when a2, who had re-established back inbounds after having gone out of bounds on his own to avoid a block, touches the rolling punt there. the punt then rolls out of bounds at the b14. ruling: b’s ball, first-and-10 on b19, or fourth-and-15 on a45. multiple fouls by a2 for a player illegally out of bounds on a kick, and illegal touching of a kick. there is no option to move the ball to the spot of the first touch and also enforce the penalty from that spot. a.r. 9.81 double change of possession—foul during return fourth-and-10 on a40. b1 catches the punt on the b25 and runs to the b35 where he fumbles. a2 recovers the fumble at the b34 and runs to the b33 where he fumbles, and b2 recovers and is downed at the b30. during b1’s run, b4 (a) illegally blocks in the back at the b37; (b) illegally blocks in the back at the b33; or (c) blocks a4 below the waist at the b32. rulings: (a) b’s ball, first-and-10 on b25. declining b’s foul results in b’s ball at the b30. when accepted, it is enforced from the b35 as a foul on a running play. there is no option to enforce b’s foul from the dead-ball spot. (b) b’s ball, first-and-10 on b23. enforcement is from the spot of foul since it is behind the spot of the fumble. (c) a’s ball, first-and-10 on b19. since the low block is a personal foul, team a gets the ball back and the penalty is enforced from where team a recovered b1’s fumble. rule 10 fair catch—signals/interference a.r. 10.1 no fair-catch signal—no protection fourth-and-5 on 50. b1 gives a valid fair-catch signal at the b10. the punted ball hits b1 in the hands and goes up in the air as b1 falls to the ground at the b12. a2 pushes b2 out of the way at the b10, catches the ball, and scores. b1 could not have caught the ball. ruling: a’s ball, first-and-goal on b10. the ball is dead where caught. b2 does not have protection, as he did not signal. a.r. 10.2 fair-catch signal—blocked into punt fourth-and-5 on 50. b1 signals for a fair catch at the b10. b1 then steps forward to the b13, allowing the ball to hit the ground behind him. a1 then blocks passive b1 (high) into the ball forcing it into the end zone. a2 recovers there. ruling: b’s ball, first-and-10 on b20. touchback. no foul by a1, as a fair catch is no longer possible once the ball hits the ground. in addition, it is not a foul for fair catch interference, because b1 is not in position to catch the kick. b1 is deemed not to have touched the ball. the block by a1 is the impetus that put the ball into the end zone. a.r. 10.3 no fair catch—catch completed out of bounds fourth-and-12 on a12. the punt is shanked off the side of the kicker’s foot. b1 is running toward the sideline at the b48 and gives a valid fair-catch signal. he catches the ball with one foot inbounds but his second step is out of bounds. time in the game expires on the play. ruling: game over. there is no option for a fair-catch kick, as the fair catch was not completed inbounds. a.r. 10.4 fair-catch signal—ball hits team a player—legal advance by team b fourth-and-10 on a40. b1 gives a legal fair-catch signal at the b15 as the ball goes over his head. the ball in flight hits a2 at the b10, who is not near a team b player. the ball bounces into the air toward b1, who catches it at the b12 and runs for a touchdown. ruling: touchdown, team b. kickoff b35. the advance by b1 is legal, since a2 touched the ball after the signal. there is no foul by a2, because there was not a team b player in position to catch the kick. 61 a.r. 10.5 advance after giving fair-catch signal fourth-and-10 on a40. b1 gives a valid fair-catch signal at the b10 and the ball hits (a) the ground; (b) a2 at the b10 while in the air; or (c) the ground and then bounces off a2’s leg. b1 or b2 then recovers the ball at the b15 and runs to the 50 where he is tackled. rulings: (a) b’s ball, first-and-10 on b15. the ball is dead when recovered by team b.

(14-5-2) (b) a’s ball, fourth-and-10 on a40. replay. double foul. because team b lost possession during the down, its foul is not post-possession, so the fouls offset at the previous spot.

or (b) a2 recovers and runs the ball into the end zone. rulings: (a) and (b): b’s ball, first-and-10 on b25. even if no signal has been given, b1 must be given an unhindered opportunity to catch the ball. the penalty is enforced from the spot of the foul. if b1 had possession of the ball beyond the b10, the penalty could be enforced from the dead-ball spot. a.r. 10.30 no fair catch signal given—punt receiver contacted after touching kick—legal fourth-and-six on a49. a1’s punt is partially blocked, and the ball goes into the air to the b47. b1 tries to catch the ball at the b46, but immediately after he touches the ball, he is run into by a6, causing him to muff it. the ball rolls to the b49 where a3 recovers. ruling: a’s ball, first-and-10 on b49. if a team b player does not give a valid fair catch signal, he may be contacted (but not roughed) immediately after he touches the punt. a.r. 10.31 interference with opportunity fourth-and-2 on 50. the punt is partially blocked by b1, and a2 and b1 both jump up to try to catch the ball at the b48. a2 catches the ball at the b48 and runs to the b40. ruling: b’s ball, first-and-10 on a37. since the punted ball crossed the los, it is interference with the opportunity to make a catch. the play should be blown dead when a2 gains possession. a.r. 10.32 interference with opportunity—kickoff on an onside kick from the a35, the ball is kicked directly into the air, and a1 leaps from the a44 and catches the ball on the a46, prior to the ball being touched by anyone. b1 could have caught the ball at the a45. ruling: b’s ball, first-and-10 on a30. interference with the opportunity to make a catch. 64 note: if the ball was kicked down into the ground from the tee, there would be no interference with the opportunity, as the rule only applies to a kick that has not touched the ground, team a would have a legal recovery at the a46, and no time would run off the clock. a.r. 10.33 fair catch made—late hit on signaler—last play of half fourth-and-10 on 50. b1 gives a valid fair-catch signal and catches the punt at the b10. a2 then tackles b1 after he completes the catch. time runs out in the half. ruling: b’s ball, first-and-10 on b25 (extend for fair-catch kick only) or team b could elect not to extend the half and have the personal foul enforced on the second half kickoff or overtime. a.r. 10.34 kick catch interference and personal foul fourth-and-10 on a45. a1’s punt is in the air as b2, who did not signal for a fair catch, prepares to catch the punt at the b15. just before the ball arrives, a4 lowers his helmet and hits b2 in the chin, causing b2 to muff the punt which is recovered by a6. officials penalize a4 and disqualify him. ruling: b’s ball, first-and-10 on b30, or a’s ball, fourth-and-25 on a30. enforcement for both the kick catch interference and personal foul would be 15 yards from the spot of the foul, but only one foul can be enforced. this is not a situation like dpi that is also a personal foul, where both fouls can be enforced. rule 11 scoring touchdown a.r. 11.1 touchdown—control in air in end zone and driven back into field of play first-and-goal on b8. tight end a2 goes into the end zone and leaps to catch a pass from a1. while he is airborne in the end zone, a2 controls the ball and is driven back to the 1-yard line by b2, where a2 lands on both feet, and not sure if he had scored, breaks free from b2, runs and it tackled at the 1- yard line. ruling: touchdown team a. kickoff a35. once a2 comes down and completes the catch, the play is over, and he is given his forward progress. a.r. 11.2 touchdown—batted pass in end zone third-and-3 on b16. a1 throws a forward pass to end a2 along the end line. a2 bats the ball toward end a3 who catches it in the end zone. ruling: touchdown team a. kickoff a35. a forward pass can be batted in any direction by either team in the end zone.

(b) option for team a: re-try from b 7 ½ (kick); or re-try from b1 (run or pass); or decline the option to re-try and enforce the penalty on the kickoff, a45. if choosing to re-try from the same spot, the penalty is enforced half the distance from the previous spot, unless the foul is defensive pass interference. if choosing to re-try from the ‘other spot’, the penalty is always half the distance. a.r. 11.13 two-point try attempt—defensive pass interference on a try attempt from the 2-yard line, b3 interferes with eligible receiver a3 in the end zone, and (a) b3 intercepts the pass intended for a3 and falls to the ground; (b) a3 catches the ball in the end zone despite the interference; or (c) b3 pulls down the receiver by the facemask before the pass arrives; the pass is incomplete. rulings: (a) re-try from the one-yard line, (run or pass); or re-try by a kick attempt from the b7½. after enforcement of the foul, team a can elect to again attempt a 2-point try from the one-yard line, because the defensive pass interference was in the end zone, or if team a chooses enforcement from the “other spot”, the enforcement is half the distance from the “other spot”, regardless of where the dpi occurred. (b) the try is good, ko a35. (although b fouls that are not used for a re-try, to negate a score, or as part of a double foul, are enforced on the kickoff, there is no specific yardage for defensive pass interference, so there is no yardage to enforce on the kickoff). (c) re-try for 2 points from the b½ yard line; or kick-try from the b3 ¾ yard line; or decline the re-try and enforce the personal foul on the kickoff and kick from the 50. team a does not have the option to enforce the defensive pass interference foul on the re-try and enforce the personal foul on the kickoff. if one foul is going to be enforced on the try, they both must be enforced on the try. note: any time defensive pass interference is enforced from the ‘other spot’, the penalty is half the distance to the goal, regardless of where the foul occurred. just as with normal pass plays, if the defensive pass interference is also a personal foul, both fouls are enforced. however, they cannot be separated to enforce one on the re-try and one on the kickoff. a.r. 11.14 try-kick attempt - unsuccessful try—defense fouls near the end of the game, team a scores and trails 21-16. on the kick-try from the b15, the kick is no good and (a) b3 lines up offside or (b) b2 forearms the center to the head just after the snap. rulings: (a) re-try (anywhere between the hash marks) from the b10 for a kick attempt; or go for 2-points from the b1; or decline the re-try and enforce the 5-yard penalty on the kickoff and kick from the a40. (b) re-try (anywhere between the hash marks) from the b 7½ for a kick attempt; or go for 2-points from the b1; or decline the re-try and enforce the 15-yard penalty on the kickoff and kick from the 50. (11-1-3-item 4(a)). a.r. 11.15 live ball and dead ball team b fouls on the try on a kick-try from the b15, b1 is offside at the snap. the kick is missed, and b2 then shoves a2, knocking him to the ground. ruling: re-try from b10 (kick); or re-try b1 (2-point) – enforcing the offside penalty and declining the personal foul. or team a can decline the opportunity to re-try and enforce b2’s personal foul on the kickoff – kickoff 50. only one 66 of the team b multiple fouls can be accepted, and if the live ball foul is declined, the try is over, and the personal foul can only be enforced on the kickoff. a.r. 11.16 unsuccessful try – offensive foul on a try attempt from the b2, a1 runs and fumbles the ball at the line of scrimmage. at the snap, a2 grabs and pulls b2’s facemask prior to the fumble. b1 recovers the loose ball, runs, and fumbles the ball at the b20. a2 picks up the loose ball, runs, and is tackled at the b1. ruling: unsuccessful try. kickoff a20. the facemask foul can be enforced on the kickoff because it was not used to negate a score or offset another foul. a.r. 11.17 try-kick attempt—5 vs. 15 during a successful or unsuccessful kick-try from the b15, b2 is called for leverage. a1 was illegally in motion at the snap. ruling: re-try at b7½ (kick) or b1 (run or pass) (a’s option). this is a 5 vs. 15, as there was no change of possession. there is no option for team a to decline the re-try and enforce the yardage on the ensuing kickoff, because the fouls are “used” as a part of the double foul enforcement. when fouls by both teams occur during a try down with no change of possession, the down must be replayed. the only exception to this would be a clean hands score (11-3-3-item 5). a.r. 11.18 before snap for try-kick attempt—5 vs. 15 before the ball is snapped on a try from the b15, a5 false starts, and b2 comes across the line and knocks a6 to the ground. unnecessary roughness is called on b2. ruling: re-try at b1 (run or pass) or b7½ (kick), kickoff at a35; or re-try at b15 (kick) or b2 (run or pass), kickoff at 50. (a’s option). this is a pre-snap 5 vs. 15 with the major foul on team b. since the dead ball fouls prevented the snap, team a can either enforce the major foul on the try or enforce it on the kickoff. (14-5-1-exc. 3) note: if the major foul of a pre-snap 5 vs. 15 is on team a, there is no option for team b to enforce the penalty yardage on the kickoff. pre-snap fouls by team a (after the ready for play), must be enforced on the succeeding try down. a.r. 11.19 try-kick attempt—5 vs. 15—clean hands score during a successful try from the b15, b2 is offside, and after the ball is dead, a2 is called for unnecessary roughness. ruling: the kick-try is good. kickoff a20. this is a clean hands score, so the score counts, and the foul against a2 is enforced on the kickoff. (14-4-9-item 3-exc. 2) a.r. 11.20 drop kick try attempt—successful—team b covers the center on a try attempt from the 15-yard line, holder a2 is on a knee 8 yards behind the center, and kicker a1 is lined up behind the holder. the ball is snapped directly to the kicker, and he drop kicks the ball between the uprights. b3 was covering the center at the snap. ruling: one-point try successful, kickoff a40; or re-try at the b1 (run or pass), kickoff a35. the restriction for team b players covering the center applies on drop kicks, if there is a normal kicking formation with a holder in place prior to the snap. all team b fouls on a try that do not result in a re-try, offset with a team a foul, or negate a score, are enforced on the ensuing kickoff. note: the restriction on covering the center keys off the formation, not what ultimately happens on the play. a.r. 11.21 two-point try attempt—foul by team a with a change of possession on a try attempt from the 2-yard line, qba1’s pass is intercepted by b4 in the end zone. b4 returns the ball to the 50. during the try: (a) tackle a7 was not on the line of scrimmage at the snap; (b) center a6 and back a2 chop blocked b7 prior to the interception; or (c) a5 tripped b4 during the return. rulings: (a) try no good, ko a35. only personal or unsportsmanlike conduct fouls by team a prior to a change of possession will carry over to the kickoff. (b) try no good, ko a20. the chop block foul is enforced on the kickoff because it is a personal foul. (c) try no good, ko a25. all team a fouls after a change of possession, that are not part of a double or multiple foul, will carry over to the kickoff. a.r. 11.22 two-point try attempt—foul by team b with a change of possession on a try attempt from the 2-yard line, qba1’s pass is intercepted by b4 in the end zone. b4 returns the ball to the 50. during the try: (a) b5 held receiver a2 prior to the pass; (b) b6 blocked a7 low at the b35 during b4’s run; or (c) b2 held a8 at the b35 during b4’s run. rulings: (a) re-try b1 (run or pass) or b10 (kick). (b) try attempt fails, ko 50. (c) try attempt fails, ko a45. note: all team b fouls during a try that do not result in a re-try, negate a score by team b, or offset with a team a foul will be enforced on the ensuing kickoff. 67 a.r. 11.23 two-point try attempt—fouls by both teams with a change of possession on a try attempt from the 2-yard line, qba1’s pass is intercepted by b4 in the end zone. b4 returns the ball to the 50. during the try: (a) b5 held receiver a2 prior to the pass and a5 blocked b3 low at the b35 during b4’s run; or (b) tackle a7 was not on the line of scrimmage at the snap and b6 blocked a7 low at the b35 during b4’s run; or (c) during b4’s run, b2 held a8 at the b35 and a1 blocked b9 low at the b30 during b4’s run. rulings: (a) re-try b2 (run or pass) or b15 (kick). if team b fouls prior to the initial change of possession, the try is replayed, regardless of subsequent fouls by either team. in this case, the fouls offset at either try spot. (b) try no good, ko a35. this is not a 5 vs. 15 as there was a change of possession and neither foul is enforced on the kickoff. (c) try no good, ko a35. since both teams fouled after the change of possession, the fouls offset and are not enforced on the kickoff. note: if there is a double foul on a try, no team b fouls will be carried over to the kickoff if they are used up to create a re-try, to negate a score by team b, or offset with a team a foul. a.r. 11.24 two-point try attempt—a fouls on successful try—b fouls on re-try on a 2-point try from the b2, runner a3 scores, but tackle a8 is called for holding. team a elects to have the 10-yard penalty enforced from the b15 and attempt a kick-try from the b25. before the snap for the kick, b3 encroaches. ruling: re-try b20 (kick), kickoff a35; re-try b7 (run or pass), kickoff a35; re-try b25 (kick), kickoff a40; or re-try b12 (run or pass) kickoff a40, team a always has the option to enforce a team b foul on the kickoff, or from the previous spot or the other try spot, the location of which is determined by any previously enforced penalty, if applicable. team a, after enforcement, can also choose where the ball is spotted between the hash marks. a.r. 11.25 try-kick attempt—pass interference and facemask on a kick try from the b15, holder a2 muffs the snap at the b23, and kicker a1 recovers at the b25 where he throws a forward pass to eligible receiver a4, who is grabbed and pulled down by the facemask before the ball arrives at the b4. the pass falls incomplete. ruling: re-try b2 (kick) or re-try b½ (run/pass). if team a chooses to again attempt a 1-point kick try, the pass interference is a spot foul putting the ball at the b4, plus half the distance to the b2 because the pass interference is also a personal foul. if team a chooses to try from the “other spot: (run/pass), the enforcement is half the distance to the goal line from the b2, and half the distance again as a result of the personal foul on the pass interference. note: team a could also choose to decline the re-try and enforce the personal foul on the kickoff, but they cannot “split” the personal foul and pass interference and enforce one on the try and one on the kickoff. safety a.r. 11.26 safety—entire ball not out of end zone second-and-10 on a2. runner a1 is tackled in his end zone with part of the ball on the goal line and part in the field of play. ruling: safety. safety kick a20. the entire ball must be out of the end zone. a.r. 11.27 blocked punt—team a bats ball fourth-and-12 on a14. a’s punt is blocked and the ball rolls to the a4 where a2 bats the ball (a) toward his goal, where a3 falls on the ball in the end zone; or (b) forward where a3 falls on the ball at the a10 rulings: (a) safety. safety kick a20. this is a legal bat, and the result of the play is a safety.

or decline the foul and accept the result of the play (resulting in b’s ball at the a10). a.r. 11.28 fumble in team b end zone—foul in field of play—team a’s impetus third-and-6 on b22. b2 intercepts a pass in the end zone, and while running in the end zone, fumbles the ball which rolls to the b3. b4 then bats the loose ball forward to the b7-yard line where b5 recovers. ruling: b’s ball, first-and-10 on b1½. note: since team a’s impetus put the ball in the end zone, the b20 is considered the spot of the fumble. the team b foul is therefore enforced from the spot of the foul, because it’s behind the spot of the fumble. if team b’s impetus had put the ball in the end zone, the spot of the fumble would be in the end zone, so the result would be a safety. a.r. 11.29 safety—personal foul on play on a kickoff from the a35, b2 catches the ball in the end zone and runs to the b4. b2 then fumbles the ball at the b4, and it rolls into the pylon on the goal line. during the fumble, b5 pulled a2 down by the facemask at the b2. ruling: safety. safety kick b10. the result of the play is a safety, so the personal foul is enforced on the safety kick regardless of where the foul occurred (see 14-4-4). 68 a.r. 11.30 safety—b commits personal foul and bats ball into team b end zone fourth-and-6 on a45. a’s punt is at the b5 when b3 bats the ball backward over the end line, creating new impetus. immediately after the snap, b3 head slaps a2 on the line of scrimmage. ruling: safety. safety kick b10. a bat (legal or illegal) creates a new impetus, so the result of the play is a safety, and the personal foul carries over to the safety kick. note: if the foul is committed in an effort to block the kick, it is not a post possession foul, so there is also an option to enforce the foul from the previous spot with an automatic first down, although team a would likely choose the points and have team b safety kick from the b10. a.r. 11.31 momentum—illegal forward pass—safety third-and-goal on b6. a1 throws to a3 in the end zone near the goal line. b2 intercepts at the b1-yard line with one foot at the b1-yard line and the other on the b½-yard line. his momentum carries him into the end zone where he attempts a backward pass which goes forward. a3 muffs the pass at the b½-yard line, and it falls incomplete. ruling: safety. safety kick b20. although b2’s momentum took him into his end zone, his foul for an illegal forward pass in the end zone creates a safety. a.r. 11.32 safety—not momentum exception – foul against an official third-and 25 on b40. the score is tied 21-21 at the two-minute warning of the fourth quarter. on a long pass thrown toward the goal line, b2 dives in front of receiver a2 and intercepts the ball at the b4. he slides untouched to a stop on the b1, gets to his feet, and to avoid tackler a3, loops into the end zone where he is tackled by a4. the field judge signals safety. b2 is infuriated by the ruling and slams the ball at the officials’ feet. ruling: safety. safety kick b10. b2’s momentum did not take him into the end zone. a second unsportsmanlike conduct foul of this category would lead to disqualification. a.r. 11.33 punt—team a fouls in own end zone—options for team b fourth-and-9 on a2. prior to a1 punting the ball from the end zone, a3 holds b2 on a block initiated in the end zone. the punt is then shanked out of bounds at the a16. ruling: safety, safety kick a20. there is no option to enforce from the dead-ball spot unless it is a personal foul or unsportsmanlike conduct foul. a.r. 11.34 no safety—momentum exception fourth-and-6 on b45. on the last play of the first half, b1 catches a punt on the b2-yard line and the momentum of the kick forces him back into the end zone. b1 is then tackled by a2 in the end zone. ruling: half over. the ball would be spotted on the b2-yard line because of the momentum exception; however, time expired on the play. a.r. 11.35 safety kick—out of bounds—potential extension of period third-and-8 on a5. quarterback a1 is sacked in his own end zone. on the ensuing safety kick, a3 punts the ball out of bounds at the b30. ruling: b’s ball, first-and-10 on 50. the penalty for a safety kick kicked out of bounds is 30 yards from the spot of the kick, or the out-of-bounds spot. if the safety occurred due to a foul by team a in their own end zone, with no time left in the game, team b would have the option to extend for an untimed down. if a free kick (including a safety kick) on the last play of a period or the extension of a period, goes out of bounds (untouched or last touched by team a), team b has the option to extend for an additional play from scrimmage. momentum exception a.r. 11.36 momentum exception—fumble in end zone third-and-6 on b23. a1 throws a pass toward a2 near the goal line. b1 intercepts the ball on the b3-yard line. his momentum carries him into the end zone where he fumbles the ball while being tackled, and: (a) b3 recovers and is downed in the end zone; (b) a3 recovers in the end zone; (c) the ball goes over the end line; or (d) the ball rolls out of bounds at the b4. rulings: (a) b’s ball, first-and-10 on b3. momentum exception. the ball is dead in the end zone in b’s possession. (b) touchdown team a. kickoff a35. there is no momentum exception, because the ball was not dead in the end zone in b’s possession. (c) b’s ball, first-and-10 on b3. momentum exception. the ball is dead in the end zone in team b’s possession. (d) b’s ball, first-and-10 on b3. momentum exception. the fumble forward out of bounds returns to the spot of the fumble, and the ball is then dead in the end zone in team b’s possession. a.r. 11.37 momentum exception—team b foul during fumble in end zone second-and-10 on b20. b1 intercepts a1’s pass on the b6, and his momentum takes him into the end zone. while b1 is running in the end zone, he fumbles the ball and it rolls into the field of play where (a) it is recovered by b2 at the b4; or (b) it rolls out of bounds at the b6. during the loose ball, b3 grabs and twists a2’s facemask at the b5. rulings: (a) safety. safety kick a20. momentum does not apply because the ball was not declared dead in the end zone in team b’s possession. this is a foul during a fumble, and the spot of the fumble (the basic spot) is in team b’s end zone, so enforcement results in a safety. 69 (b) b’s ball, first-and-10 on b2½. the fumble forward out of bounds, returns the ball to the spot of the fumble in the end zone. the ball is therefore dead in b’s possession in the end zone, thus giving b the ball at that spot of interception momentum (b6). b’s foul is enforced from the spot of the foul, which is behind the momentum spot. a.r. 11.38 momentum exception—foul in field of play first-and-10 on b16. b1 intercepts a pass at the b6, and his momentum carries him into the end zone. while still in the end zone, b1 throws a backward pass to b2, which goes over the end line. during b1’s run in the end zone, b4 tripped a3 at the b8. ruling: b’s ball, first-and-10 on b3. since the ball is dead in team b’s possession in the end zone, the dead ball spot is the momentum spot - the b6. the tripping foul is therefore enforced from the b6, (the dead ball spot), rather than the spot of the foul - the b8. a.r. 11.39 momentum—illegal forward pass team b in own end zone—interception team a first-and-10 on b16. b1 intercepts a pass or recovers a fumble or backward pass by a1 at the b6, and his momentum carries him into the end zone. b1 tries to run the ball out, sees that he will be tackled, and throws an illegal forward pass to b2 which is intercepted by a3 at the b2-yard line and carried into the end zone. ruling: touchdown team a. kickoff a35. decline the foul for illegal forward pass because enforcement would result in a safety. a.r. 11.40 momentum—fumble recovery on a kickoff from the a35, b2 returns the ball to the a15-yard line where the ball is punched out of his hands from behind by a1. the ball is scooped up by a1 on the run at the a6, and his momentum carries him forward into his end zone, where (a) a1 is tackled; or (b) a1 fumbles the ball and b2 recovers it in a’s end zone. rulings: (a) a’s ball, first-and-10 on a6. team a was the defensive team when a1 recovered b2’s fumble, so the momentum exception applies. (b) touchdown team b. kickoff b35. the ball was not dead in the end zone in a’s possession; therefore, there is no momentum exception. note: momentum only applies to the team that has just gained possession after a change of possession. in this case, it would be team a after recovery of a fumble by team b. momentum does not apply to a team regaining possession of their own fumble, pass or kick. a.r. 11.41 not momentum—progress stopped third-and-6 on b16. a1 throws a pass toward a3 in the end zone. b2 intercepts the ball with both feet down at the b1-yard line and is driven back into the end zone by a6. b2 fumbles over the end line as he is tackled by a6. ruling: b’s ball, first-and-10 on b1. forward progress at the b1-yard line. for the momentum exception to apply, b2’s own momentum must cause him to go into the end zone. a.r. 11.42 not momentum—ball not dead in the end zone—forward progress first-and-10 on b16. b1 recovers a fumble by a1 at the b6, and his momentum causes him to slide feet first into the end zone where he is touched down by a2. both of b1’s feet are in the end zone, but the ball is at the b½. ruling: b’s ball, first-and-10 on b½. the ball must get into the end zone for the momentum exception to apply. in this case, b1’s forward progress is deemed stopped at the b½. a.r. 11.43 momentum—pass intercepted at goal line first-and-10 on b25. a1 throws a pass to end a2 at the b2. b1 intercepts while airborne, and his first foot hits at the b1, then (a) his second foot lands on the goal line with the ball in the field of play at the b½-yard line; (b) his second foot hits at the ½-yard line with the ball over the goal line; or (c) both feet land in the field of play with the ball at the ½-yard line. b continues into the end zone where he is tackled. rulings: (a) b’s ball, first-and-10 on b20. touchback, as the second foot landed in the end zone. (b) b’s ball, first-and-10 on b1. momentum exception. the key is where the feet are when the pass is intercepted, not the position of the ball in relation to the goal line. (c) b’s ball, first-and-10 on b1. momentum exception, as both feet landed in the field of play. the ball is never spotted inside the one-yard line on a momentum exception play. a.r. 11.44 momentum—muffed punt—dead ball foul fourth-and-5 on b45. b2 attempts to catch a punt at the b5 but muffs the ball, and it rolls to the b2. b3 recovers at the b2, and his momentum carries him into the end zone, where he is tackled. after the play, b5 taunts a4. ruling: b’s ball, first-and-10 on the b1. enforce the taunting from the momentum spot, as that is the succeeding spot. since the punt was muffed, it is still considered a kick and momentum applies. b5 is charged with his first unsportsmanlike conduct foul that would count toward disqualification a.r. 11.45 momentum—foul in end zone during run fourth-and-10 on 50. b1 fields the punted ball on the b5, and his momentum takes him into the end zone, where he runs to the other side of the end zone in an effort to run the ball out, but he is tackled in the end zone (or the field of play). during the run, b2 blocks a2 in the back, in the end zone. 70 ruling: safety b. ko b20. if a team runs with the ball and fouls in its end zone, enforcement of the foul results in a safety. a.r. 11.46 momentum—foul in end zone during run third-and-10 on b40. a1’s pass is intercepted by b1 at the b5, and his momentum carries him into the end zone where he falls to the ground and is touched down. while b1’s momentum was taking him into the end zone, b3 blocked a3 low in the end zone. ruling: safety. safety kick b20. even though his momentum takes him into the end zone, team b fouled in its own end zone during the run which results in a safety. it would also be a safety if b1 was downed in the field of play. (14-4-4) a.r. 11.47 not momentum—fumble in end zone—ball declared dead in field of play third-and-10 on b40. a1’s pass is intercepted by b1 at the b6, and his momentum carries him into the end zone where he scrambles to try and run it out. while he is running in the end zone, b1 fumbles, and the ball rolls out to the b5 where it is recovered by b1. during the fumble, while the ball was rolling in the field of play, b2 holds a2: (a) at the b4; or (b) in the end zone. rulings: (a) safety. safety kick b20. momentum does not apply because the ball was not declared dead in the end zone in team b’s possession. (b) safety. safety kick b20. field goal a.r. 11.48 missed field goal—downed or advanced by team a fourth-and-4 on b36. team a’s field-goal attempt from the b44 is partially blocked, and the ball (a) bounces in the end zone and rolls over the end line; (b) hits on the b33 and then bounces to the b37 where team a recovers and downs it; or (c) hits on the b33 and then bounces back to the b37 where a2 recovers the ball and advances to the b34. rulings: (a) b’s ball, first-and-10 on b44. (b) b’s ball, first-and-10 on b37. (c) b’s ball, first-and-10 on b34. note: if the kick ends behind the line of scrimmage, the option to return to the spot of the kick (or 20) is lost. this includes a play in which the kick has been beyond the line and returns behind it, regardless of whether it was or was not touched beyond the line. a.r. 11.49 missed field goal—team a foul fourth-and-10 on b24. a1 attempts a field goal from the b32 which is partially blocked and is rolling on the ground at the b8, when it is touched there by b2. it is then recovered by a3 at the b3. during the field-goal attempt, a3 stepped on the sideline at the b15 to avoid b7’s block (no contact by b) before recovering the ball. ruling: fourth-and-15 on b29. it is a five-yard penalty for a kicking team player to voluntarily go out of bounds to avoid being blocked during the kick. the only option for enforcing the foul by team a is the previous spot. if the foul were to be declined, it would be a’s ball at the b3. a.r. 11.50 missed field goal – team a foul fourth-and-seven on b37. kicker a1 attempts a field goal from the b45. the kick is short and rolls to the b4 where a6, who had stepped on the sideline to avoid a block at the b11 and had re-established back inbounds at the b9 and muffs the ball at the b9. the ball rolls to the b12 where b8 recovers and downs the ball. ruling: b’s ball, first-and-10 on b12 or a’s ball, fourth-and-12 on b42. team b can decline the penalties for illegal touching and voluntarily going out of bounds by a6, or they can choose to enforce one of the fouls from the previous spot. there is no other enforcement option on a missed field goal. (there is also a first touch at the b9, but team b would not take that option on this play.) a.r. 11.51 team a foul prior to / during missed field goal fourth-and-10 on b18. a1’s field-goal attempt from the b26 is short and rolling toward the end zone, when a2 grabs and twists the facemask of b1. the untouched kick then rolls into the end zone. a3 was illegally in motion when the ball was snapped. ruling: b’s ball, first-and-10 on b41, or a’s ball, fourth-and-25 on b33. team b has the option to enforce the personal foul from the succeeding spot, which is the spot of the kick. a.r. 11.52 team a foul during missed field goal—returned for touchdown fourth-and-10 on b38. a1 attempts a field goal from the b46 which is short and caught in the end zone by b1. b1 returns the kick for a touchdown. before the kick, (a) a5 pulled b2 down to the ground by his facemask, or (b) a3 holds b3 at the line of scrimmage before the kick. rulings: (a) touchdown team b. team b has the option to enforce the personal foul on the try or the kickoff. (b) touchdown team b. kickoff b35. only personal fouls or unsportsmanlike conduct fouls carry over to the try or kickoff. the penalty for holding is declined. 71 a.r. 11.53 missed field goal—kick inside 20 fourth-and-6 on b11. a field-goal attempt from the b19 is wide and goes over the end line. ruling: b’s ball, first-and-10 on b20. a.r. 11.54 missed field goal—team b touches in field of play fourth-and-9 on b39. a1’s field-goal attempt from the b47 is missed, and the ball is rolling at the b11 where b5 picks it up and returns it to the b18. ruling: b’s ball, first-and-10 on b18. when team b touches the missed field goal in the field of play or the end zone, b loses the right to take the ball at the spot of the kick. a.r. 11.55 missed field goal—spot of kick option fourth-and-10 on b43. a1 attempts a long field goal from the 50, which is shanked and rolls dead at the b2-yard line. b3 is offside on the play. ruling: fourth-and-5 on b38. if team a declines the defense offside penalty, team b will get the ball at the spot of the kick - the 50-yard line - as a result of the missed field goal. if a team b penalty is declined, that penalty does not affect team b’s option to take the ball at the spot of the kick on a missed field goal. note: team b does not have the option to take the ball at the spot of the kick if (1) b touches the ball beyond the line of scrimmage, or (2) the kick ends behind the line, or (3) a team b foul during the play is accepted. a.r. 11.56 missed field goal—third down—recovered or goes out of bounds behind the line third-and-2 on b9. a field-goal attempt from the b17 is blocked and: (a) goes out of bounds at the b18; (b) is recovered by a2 at the b15 who runs for a touchdown; c) is recovered simultaneously by a3 and b3 at the b21; (d) is recovered by a4 at the b19; (e) is recovered and downed by b2 at the b15; (f) goes beyond the line and then returns behind the line, touched or untouched by team b beyond the line in the field of play, and goes out of bounds at the b16 or is recovered by a2 at the b16; or (g) goes beyond the line and returns behind the line, untouched by team b beyond the line, and is recovered by a2 at the b16. rulings (a) b’s ball, first-and-10 on b18. if a third down scrimmage kick goes out of bounds or is simultaneously recovered, the ball belongs to team b. (b) touchdown team a. kickoff a35. since the scrimmage kick was recovered by team a behind the line of scrimmage, the advance is legal. (c) b’s ball, first-and-10 on b21. if a third down scrimmage kick is simultaneously recovered, the ball belongs to team b. (d) a’s ball fourth-and-12 on b19. since the scrimmage kick was made on third down, team a keeps possession if they recover the kick behind the line. (e) b’s ball, first-and-10 on b15. since the end of the kick was behind the line of scrimmage, team b does not have the option to take the ball at the spot of the kick. (f) b’s ball, first-and-10 on b16. since the end of the kick was behind the line of scrimmage, team b does not have the option to take the ball at the spot of the kick. (g) a’s ball, fourth-and-9 on b16. since the ball was not touched by team b beyond the line and was recovered by team a behind the line, the down counts. team a retains possession because the kick occurred on third down. note: team b does not have the option to take the ball at the spot of the kick if (1) b touches the ball beyond the line of scrimmage, or (2) a team b foul during the play is accepted, or (3) the kick ends behind the line (including either team recovering the ball behind the line, or the kick going out of bounds behind the line). a.r. 11.57 missed field goal—touched/untouched by team b beyond line fourth-and-10 on b34. a field-goal attempt is kicked from the b42 and is missed, and (a) the ball is touched by b1 at the b5 and then rolls into the end zone where b2 downs it; or (b) the untouched kick rolls into the end zone where it is downed by b2. rulings: (a) b’s ball, first-and-10 on b20. touchback. (b) b’s ball, first-and-10 on b42. the ball is dead immediately when it hits in the end zone, untouched by team b in the field of play or the end zone, so it is therefore brought back to the spot of the kick. a.r. 11.58 blocked field goal—touched by b beyond line and returns behind line—illegal pass fourth-and-2 on b6. a field-goal attempt from the b14 is partially blocked, hits b1 at the b3, and bounces back to the b8. a1 picks it up and from the b8 throws a forward pass to a2 who scores. ruling: a’s ball, first-and-10 on b13. legal recovery by a1, but this is an illegal forward pass, because b’s touching beyond the line causes a change of possession by rule. first down for team a, and a five-yard penalty from the spot of the pass. a.r. 11.59 missed field goal—kick is touched by both team a and team b fourth-and-5 on b35. a1 attempts a field goal from the b43 that is partially blocked at the line of scrimmage. the ball rolls to the b22 where a2 touches it. the ball then touches b3 at the b18 and is finally recovered by a4 at the b15. ruling: b’s ball, first-and-10 on b22. b’s ball at the spot of a’s first touching. 72 a.r. 11.60 missed field goal—team a personal foul during the kick fourth-and-6 on b17. during a field-goal attempt from the b25, a6 and a7 chop block b8 at the line of scrimmage. the kick is blocked and: (a) goes out of bounds at the b22; (b) b2 tries to recover the ball at the b14 but muffs it out of bounds at the b12; (c) rolls to the b5 where a2 downs it there; (d) goes to the b6 where b3 falls on the ball; or (e) is recovered by b4 at the b2 and is advanced to the a35 where he is tackled. rulings: (a) b’s ball, first-and-10 on b37. on a missed field-goal attempt, a unr/uns foul by the kicking team is enforced from the succeeding spot when the receiving team is awarded the ball. the succeeding spot is where the kick ends behind the line of scrimmage. (b) b’s ball, first-and-10 on b27. since team b touched the ball beyond the line of scrimmage, the succeeding spot is where the ball becomes dead in its possession. (c) b’s ball, first-and-10 on b40. since the ball was untouched beyond the line of scrimmage by team b and downed by team a, the succeeding spot is the spot where the kick was attempted. (d) b’s ball, first-and-10 on b21. since team b downed the ball beyond the line of scrimmage, the succeeding spot is where the ball becomes dead in b’s possession. (e) b’s ball, first-and-10 on a20. team b can recover and advance the ball because it is a scrimmage kick. the succeeding spot is the end of the run and team a’s foul will be enforced from that spot. a.r. 11.61 missed field goal—team b fouls after the kick fourth-and-4 on b35. a1’s field-goal attempt from the b43 is partially blocked at the line of scrimmage. the ball rolls out of bounds at the b15. while the ball was loose, b2 clips at the b12. ruling: b’s ball, first-and-10 on b6. this is a post possession foul, because the foul did not occur in an effort to block the kick. a.r. 11.62 missed field goal—double foul with change of possession fourth-and-10 on b20. a field-goal attempt from the b28 is partially blocked and rolls out of bounds at the b30. team a had only six men on the line. after the kick is out of bounds, b1 clips at the b10. ruling: b’s ball, first-and-10 on b15, or a’s ball fourth-and-10 on b20 replay. double foul with a change of possession. a.r. 11.63 missed field goal—double foul with change of possession fourth-and-5 on b30. a1’s field-goal attempt from the b38 is blocked behind the line of scrimmage. b3 picks up the loose ball and runs for a touchdown. during b3’s run, b4 blocks low at the a15. a2 was illegally in motion at the snap. ruling: b’s ball, first-and-10 on a30. double foul with a change of possession. they also would have the option to replay the down, but team b would never take that option. a.r. 11.64 missed field goal – double foul after a change of possession fourth-and-5 on b30. a1’s field-goal attempt from the b38 is partially blocked at the line of scrimmage. b3 picks up the loose ball at the b10 and runs to the b30, where a3 pulls him down by the facemask. while the kick was rolling at the b20, b1 clipped a2 at the b15. ruling: b’s ball, first-and-10 on b10. this is a double foul after a change of possession, since b’s foul was a post possession foul during the kick. the fouls offset at the end of the kick, since that spot is behind the spot of the foul. on a double after, the ball is placed at the spot team b’s foul be enforced if it were the only foul on the play. a.r. 11.65 missed fair-catch kick—treated as a missed field goal after completing a fair catch at the team a40, team b elects the option of a fair-catch kick but kicks the ball wide and short, hitting in the end zone and bouncing back and out of bounds at the a2-yard line without touching any player. ruling: a’s ball, first-and-10 on a40. a missed fair catch kick is treated the same as a missed field goal. the referee would wind the clock when the ball is kicked. a.r. 11.66 field goal good—foul by team b fourth-and-5 on b22. a1’s field-goal attempt from the b30 is good. on the play, b3 head slaps a2 on the line of scrimmage immediately after the snap, displacing a2, to allow a teammate to shoot through in an attempt to block the kick. ruling: option: award three points and kickoff 50, or a’s ball, first-and-10 on b11. the head slap is a foul for unnecessary roughness. a.r. 11.67 field goal attempt hits official fourth-and-5 on b15. a’s field-goal attempt from the b23 is low and the ball hits the side judge prior to going over the upright. ruling: the field goal is good. kickoff a35. a.r. 11.68 field-goal attempt—last play of game—(5 vs. 15)—major foul on team b fourth-and-6 on b22. team b leads 33-32. a1 attempts a field goal from the b30 that is good. team a has six men on the line of scrimmage, and b2 head slaps a2 at the line of scrimmage immediately after the snap. time in the game expires on the play. 73 ruling: a’s ball, first-and-10 on b11. extend for one down; 5 vs. 15 with the major live ball foul by the defense. had the kick been unsuccessful, there would be a change of possession, thus no 5 vs. 15. the down would be replayed at the previous spot. note: if b2’s foul had been a dead ball penalty after the kick was declared dead, the game would be over with team b winning 33-32, no enforcement of the penalty, and no extension. a.r. 11.69 field-goal attempt— last play of the game - 5 vs. 15—major foul on team a fourth-and-5 on b16. kicker a1 attempts a field goal from the b24 that is good. on the play, a2 leg whips b2 on the line of scrimmage. b3 was offside at the snap. time in the game expires on the play with team b leading 21-20. ruling: no score. game over.

(b) third-and-10 on b40. no foul. (c) first-and-10 on b35. illegal hands to the face. note: if the contact is direct and forcible, it is a foul, even without pinning the head back for a period of time. this standard applies to both offensive and defensive players. a.r. 12.5 hands to the face—defense against wide receiver second-and-10 on b40. b2 is playing wide receiver a2 tight at the line of scrimmage and immediately following the snap: (a) b2 puts his hand on a2’s facemask and pushes a2’s head back, but immediately releases it; or (b) b2 delivers a blow to a2’s facemask or helmet with an open hand. a1’s pass is incomplete. rulings: (a) first-and-10 on b35. illegal hands to the face by b2 against the wide receiver. this is a foul regardless of whether the play is a run or a pass. this same action by a defensive/offensive lineman against an opponent would not be a foul in close-line play. (12-1-7) (b) first-and-10 on b25. unnecessary roughness. a.r. 12.6 defensive holding—pull-and-shoot fourth-and-7 on b16. at the snap, b1 grabs tackle a5 at the line of scrimmage and pulls him back to the b14. this allows b2 to shoot the gap in an attempt to block kicker a1’s field goal attempt from the b24. however, (a) b2 stops at the line of scrimmage and does not continue through the opening; or (b) b2 is blocked at the line scrimmage by the wingback who slides over to block him. the field goal is good. rulings: (a) field goal is good. kickoff a35. there is no foul for “pull-and-shoot” if no one attempts to “shoot.” (b) a’s ball, first-and-10 on b11, or fg good ko a35. defensive holding is called even if the “shooter” is blocked by someone else. on a fg, there is no option for team a to take the score and enforce the 5-yard penalty on the kickoff, as there would be on a try. a.r. 12.7 defensive holding—not tripping second-and-9 on b45. a1 runs to the b41 where he is tackled. during the run, b2 reaches out and grabs blocker a2 by the ankle at the b43, causing a2 to go down. 75 ruling: a’s ball, first-and-10 on b36. this is defensive holding, not tripping. a.r. 12.8 block in the back—into the tackle fourth-and-10 on a40. a1’s punt is fielded by b1 at the b10, and during the return, b2 pushes a2 squarely in the back at the b15, but the push actually pushes a2 into b1 at the b12 where he makes the tackle. ruling: b’s ball, first-and-10 on b6. this is a foul for a block in the back. a.r. 12.9 pass blocking—block in the back second-and-10 on b40. as quarterback a1 is in the pocket, lineman a2 is attempting to block defensive end b2. b2 gets completely past a2, and (a) a2; or (b) a3 (another lineman) pushes b2 directly in the back, pushing him past a1. a1 then completes the pass for a touchdown. rulings: in both (a) and (b): touchdown. this is a legal block because the contact occurred while the quarterback was still in the pocket. a.r. 12.10 pass blocking—qb out of the pocket—block in the back second-and-10 on b40. after quarterback a1 has scrambled out of the pocket, lineman a2 loses contact with defensive end b2. b2 has an unrestricted path to a1, but a2 pushes b2 directly in the back, causing him to miss the tackle. a1 passes to a2 for a touchdown. ruling: second-and-20 on 50. the illegal block in the back should be called, because the quarterback was, (or had been), out of the pocket. a.r. 12.11 block in the back—punt in the air—team a or b fourth-and-10 on 50. while a1’s punt is in the air: (a) b1 blocks flyer a2 in the back at the b18 and then b1 fair catches the punt at the b12; (b) b1 blocks flyer a2 in the back at the b18 and then the untouched punt rolls into the end zone; or (c) a3 blocks b4 in the back at the b40, after which the untouched punt rolls into the end zone. rulings: (a) b’s ball, first-and-10 on b6. post possession enforcement. (12-1-3-b) (b) b’s ball, first-and-10 on b9. since the ball is still alive at the time of the block, this is post-possession enforcement from the spot of the foul, which is behind the end of the kick (b20). (c) fourth-and-20 on a40 or b’s ball, first-and-10 on b30. a.r. 12.12 offensive holding at time of tackle as b1 is returning the opening kickoff, (a) b2 holds a2 as a2 is making the tackle at the b30; or (b) b2 holds a2 at the b30, five yards away from the runner, as b1 is being tackled by a3 at the b35. rulings: (a) b’s ball, first-and-10 on b35. no foul. offensive holding will not be called if the runner is being simultaneously tackled by any defensive player. (b) b’s ball, first-and-10 on b35. no foul. a.r. 12.13 tripping or leg whip second-and-10 on b40. as qba1 drops back to pass, blocker a2 is beaten by b2 on the pass rush. a2 falls to the ground and (a) throws his leg out (no whipping motion); or (b) whips his leg around in an attempt to keep b2 from sacking the quarterback. a2’s leg makes contact with b2 either above or below the knees. a1 runs to the b15. rulings: (a) second-and-20 on 50. tripping. (12-1-8) (b) second-and-25 on a45. unnecessary roughness (leg whip). in both situations, if there is a whipping motion, it is a personal foul for a leg whip, regardless of where the contact occurs. a.r. 12.14 illegally kicking/batting the ball—potential runoff after two-minute warning third-and-5 at b40. there is 1:35 remaining in the fourth quarter, and team b is ahead in the score, 22-20. qb a1 muffs a hand to hand snap, and while the ball is loose on the ground (a) at the b41, or (b) at the b38, a1 deliberately kicks or bats it out of bounds at the b34. rulings: (a) and (b) fourth-and-15 on 50. this is a foul during a fumble, so the enforcement spot is the spot of the fumble. since that spot is behind the line of scrimmage, the foul is enforced from the previous spot, with a loss of down. in addition, team b can elect a 10-second runoff and start the clock on the ready, as this was an intentional foul that stopped the clock. it is a 10-yard penalty and a loss of down for team a to illegally kick or bat the ball on a scrimmage play. note: if the foul for illegal kicking or batting occurs beyond the line of scrimmage on a scrimmage kick play, the foul is enforced as a foul on a scrimmage kick play, and there is no loss of down. roughing/running into the kicker a.r. 12.15 running/not running into kicker—ball touched by b fourth-and-10 on a40. team b puts a strong rush on the punter, and after b4 deflects the kick: (a) he runs into the kicker; or (b) b5 runs into the kicker. the punt goes out of bounds at the b6. rulings: (a) b’s ball, first-and-10 on b6. no foul. (b) fourth-and-5 on a45 or b’s ball, first-and-10 on b6 (decline). since b5 did not touch the punt, he cannot run into or rough the kicker. 76 a.r. 12.16 not running into kicker—ball hits ground fourth-and-4 on a40. punter a1 muffs the snap at the a33 where it hits the ground. a1 recovers the ball at the a30, and is run into by b1 while punting the ball. b2 recovers the ball at the b25. ruling: b’s ball, first-and-10 at b25. no foul. once the ball hits the ground on a punt, there can be no roughing or running into the kicker. normal unnecessary roughness protection applies. a.r. 12.17 running into or roughing the kicker fourth-and 6 on a45. a1 punts the ball which goes out of bounds at the b10. b1, attempting to block the punt: (a) brushes a1 with his right shoulder, but a1 remains upright; (b) hits a1’s kicking leg while it is extended, knocking a1 to the ground; (c) slides into a1’s plant leg, knocking him to the ground; (d) hits a1’s plant leg directly, knocking a1 to the ground; or (e) collides with a1 in the inner-thigh area or torso of his body, knocking a1 to the ground. rulings: (a) b’s ball, first-and-10 on b10. no foul. there is no foul, if the contact with the kicker is incidental and minimal. (b) fourth-and-1 on 50, or b’s ball first-and-10 on b10. running into the kicker. (c) a’s ball, first-and-10 on b40. roughing the kicker. (d) a’s ball, first-and-10 on b40. roughing the kicker. (e) a’s ball, first-and-10 on b40. roughing the kicker. a.r. 12.18 running/roughing/unnecessary roughness—ball skips off ground fourth-and-3 on a45. the snap to punter a1 is low and skips off the ground once, but is fielded cleanly by a1, and a1 is able to begin his normal punting motion. (a) b2 runs into a1 (not roughing); (b) b2 collides with a2 squarely in the torso (normally enough for roughing); or (c) b2 throws a forearm into a2’s helmet. b2 does not block the punt. the punt is shanked out of bounds on the b45. rulings: (a) b’s ball, first-and-10 on b45. no foul for running into the kicker, since the snap hit the ground. (12-2-10-e) (b) b’s ball, first-and-10 on b45. no foul for roughing the kicker, since the snap hit the ground. (12-2-10-e) (c) a’s ball, first-and-10 on b40. unnecessary roughness. if the snap touches the ground, only unnecessary roughness protection applies, and if the contact is unnecessary roughness, it is a foul whether or not b2 touches the punt. a.r. 12.19 contact with kicker—second foot just hits ground fourth-and-10 on b30. field-goal kicker a1 kicks the ball at the b38 and his second foot just comes down to the ground when: (a) b1 slides into a1 taking his feet out from under him and causing a1 to go to the ground; or (b) b1 bumps a1 on his feet causing a1 to stumble. the field goal is no good. rulings: (a) a’s ball, first-and-10 on b15. roughing the kicker. (running into the kicker is not an option when the second foot has come back to the ground. if the contact is significant, this is roughing the kicker.) (b) b’s ball, first-and-10 on b38 (the spot of the kick). no foul. once the second foot has come back to the ground the only potential fouls are roughing the kicker or unnecessary roughness. a.r. 12.20 roughing/not roughing the holder fourth-and-12 on b30. b2 leaves his feet in an attempt to block a1’s field goal attempt from the b38. he misses the kick and: (a) lands in front of holder a2 and slides into him knocking him off his knees and to the ground; or (b) makes slight contact with a2 and does not knock him over. the field goal is good. rulings: (a) field goal good, kickoff 50 or first-and-10 on b15 (take points off board). roughing the holder. (b) field goal good, kickoff a35. no foul. there is no foul for running into the holder. roughing is the only option against the holder. roughing the passer the following mechanics and interpretations pertain to quarterback protection: (1) when a quarterback runs an option and keeps the ball, he is a runner. he has none of the special protections given to a passer. normal unnecessary roughness rules apply. it does not matter whether he is in or outside the pocket area. if the quarterback on an option pitches the ball to a player, his only protection before or after the pitch is that provided under normal unnecessary roughness rules. he does not receive any of the special protections granted to a player who throws a forward pass while on the run. the player who receives the pitch does not have any special “defenseless player” protection. (2) when the passer goes outside the pocket area and either continues moving with the ball (without attempting to advance the ball as a runner) or throws while on the run, he loses the protection of the one-step rule and the protection against a low hit, but retains the other special protections afforded to a passer in the pocket. if a quarterback attempts to advance the ball as a runner, he loses all of the special protections of the roughing-the-passer rule. however, if he throws while on the run, he regains all the special protections except the one-step rule and low hit rule. if he stops behind the line and clearly establishes a passing posture, he is covered by all of the special protections for passers. 77 (3) when a quarterback retreats to pass, but brings the ball down and begins to advance as a runner, he no longer has roughing-the-passer protection, even when his path of advance is within the pocket. (4) when a quarterback retreats to pass, and moves in an attempt to avoid the pass rush, even if he is moving forward in the pocket he has roughing-the-passer protection until he clearly becomes a runner. (5) when a quarterback hands off to a teammate and carries out his fake, his only protection is normal unnecessary roughness rules. helmet-to-helmet contact is not necessarily illegal. (6) if a defensive player is blocked or fouled into the quarterback and violates any of the roughing-the-passer rules, it is not a foul unless the contact is avoidable. this is the same standard that applies for low hits. (7) a receiver who is attempting to catch a swing pass is a “defenseless player,” whether the pass is forward or backward. this also applies to screen passes. a.r. 12.21 roughing the passer second-and-10 on b35. quarterback a1 rolls out of the pocket, and while moving, completes a pass to a2 who runs out of bounds at the b12. just after a1 released the ball, b1 launches and hits a1 in the chest area with the hairline part of the helmet and then continues to rip up and contact a1 under the chin with his helmet. ruling: a’s ball, first-and-goal on b6. roughing the passer. a.r. 12.22 roughing the passer third-and-5 on 50. quarterback a1, in the pocket, throws a pass to a2, who runs for a touchdown. just after a1 released the ball, b1 lowers his head and hits a1 with the hairline part of his helmet in the chest area. ruling: touchdown team a, with the option to enforce the roughing the passer foul on the try or the kickoff. a.r. 12.23 roughing/not roughing the passer (no pass thrown) second-and-10 on b35. quarterback a1 drops back to pass, and while he is standing in the pocket at the b46, b1 tackles him from behind by (a) driving the crown of his helmet into the back of a1; (b) contacting a1’s head with his forearm; (c) forcibly tackling a1 below the knees; or (d) diving and landing on the ground while swiping with his arm and catching a1 around the calf. a1 lands on the ground at the b45. rulings: (a), (b), and (c): first-and-10 on b20. roughing the passer. (12-2-9) (d) third-and-20 on b45. no foul. not forcible contact in the knee area or below. a.r. 12.24 roughing the passer—fumble recovered by defense second-and-2 on b35. quarterback a1 drops back to pass. b1 tackles him from behind by driving his lowered head into the back of a1, contacting a1’s head with his forearm, or tackling a1 below the knees at the b44. as a1 is hit, the ball leaves a1’s hand at the b45. the referee correctly rules fumble. b2 recovers the ball at the b47. ruling: a’s ball, first-and-10 on b20. the quarterback was in a passing posture, so in each instance it is a foul for roughing the passer. a.r. 12.25 roughing the passer—illegal forward pass second-and-10 at the 50. a1 scrambles, runs to the b49, retreats to the a45, and then passes the ball to a2 at the b40. after the ball has left a1’s hand, b1 takes two steps and hits quarterback a1 facemask-to-facemask as he tackles him. ruling: second-and-10 on 50. roughing the passer and illegal forward pass this is not a 5 vs 15 because the ifp foul carries a loss of down penalty, so the fouls offset at the previous spot. roughing-the-passer rules apply on all legal and illegal forward passes thrown from behind the line of scrimmage. a.r. 12.26 action against quarterback when pass is thrown from beyond line second-and-10 on a20. quarterback a1 drops back to pass but is chased out of the pocket and scrambles. at the a21, believing he is still behind the line, a1 throws a pass to a2 who catches the ball and goes out of bounds at the a35. just as a1 releases the pass, b2: (a) b2 hits him helmet to helmet in an attempt to tackle him; (b) b2’s arm hits a1’s helmet as b2 tries to tackle him; (c) b2 clubs a1 in the head as he attempts to make the tackle; or (d) b2 tackles a1 below the knees. rulings: (a) second-and-10 on a20. replay the down. this is unnecessary roughness and an illegal forward pass, but it is not a 5 vs. 15, because the illegal forward pass beyond the line is not a simple 5.

(b) second-and-20 on a15. blindside block, because the block occurred outside the normal position of the tackles. note: it is not a foul for a blindside block if the forcible contact occurs in “close line play” prior to the ball leaving that area. the ball is not considered to have left that area if the player who takes the snap, either from a shotgun position or from under center, retreats in the pocket immediately or with a slight delay, and hands the ball to another player, or runs with the ball himself. this exception does not apply to any action other than a designed play. any forcible contact in “close line play” is still subject to the restrictions for crackback and peel back blocks. a.r. 12.45 blindside block—ball in / out of tackle to tackle area second-and-10 on 50. qb a1 hands off to a2 who runs off right tackle to the b25. immediately after the snap, receiver a3, who was on the line of scrimmage and split 5 yards outside the right tackle at the snap, comes back toward the ball and blocks nose guard b1 who had crossed the line of scrimmage and was at the a48 behind the original position of the offensive right guard. the block is with force, shoulder to shoulder. (a) a1 was a t-quarterback, or (b) a1 was in shotgun at the snap, 5 yards behind the line. ruling: in (a) and (b): first-and-10 on b25. legal block because the block occurred in an area within 3 yards of the line of scrimmage from tackle to tackle before the ball left that area. the ball is not considered to have left that area due to a shotgun snap, so long as the ensuing action is a designed run play. a.r. 12.46 blindside block / legal block second-and-5 on a30. a2 takes a handoff from a shotgun or t-qb and starts to sweep around the right end. as he is (a) behind the normal position of the right tackle, or (b) behind the normal position of the tight end, he stops and changes direction toward the middle of the field. left tackle a3 sees a2 change direction, runs toward him, and forcibly blocks defensive end b2 at the a28 in the chest with his head (not uoh), forearm, or shoulder. the block occurs behind the normal right guard position and is parallel to the line of scrimmage. a2 runs to the 50, where he is tackled. rulings: (a) first-and-10 on the 50. this is a legal block, as it occurred within the tackle to tackle area, within 3 yards of the line of scrimmage, and before the ball left that area. (b) second-and-20 on a15. blindside block. although this block occurs within the tackle to tackle area, and within 3 yards of the line of scrimmage, the block occurred after the ball left that area. note: once the ball leaves the tackle to tackle area within 3 yards of the line of scrimmage, the area disappears and a block that satisfies the requirements of a blindside block is illegal even if the ball re-enters that area. a.r. 12.47 crackback—unbalanced formation—flexed first-and-10 on b25. left tackle a3 lines up on the right side of the line, creating an unbalanced formation, with tight end a2 lined up to the right of a3. right tight end a2 then cracks back at the line of scrimmage. a1 runs around right end to the b15. ruling: first-and-25 on b40. a2 is flexed and thus prohibited from cracking back. a.r. 12.48 low block in the process of tackling/failing to tackle runner third-and-10 on b20. b1 intercepts a1’s pass on the b10 and returns it with blockers b2 and b3 directly in front of b1. during the return, at the b40, a1 dives low in an attempt to tackle b1, and in the process: (a) goes through b2 below the waist before making the tackle at the b40; or (b) misses the tackle and then makes contact with b7 below the waist. b1 runs out of bounds at the 50. rulings: (a) b’s ball, first-and-10 on a45. illegal low block. (b) b’s ball, first-and-10 on 50. no foul. 81 note: if a1 is attempting to make the tackle, he cannot go low through an opponent to get to the ball carrier. if, after attempting to make a tackle, he accidentally makes contact with an opponent below the waist, it is not a foul for an illegal low block. a.r. 12.49 low block team b—punt fourth-and-2 on a45. team a lines up in a punt formation. after the ball is kicked, flyer a4 is blocked below the waist from the front by b4 at the 50. b1 fair catches the punt at the b14. ruling: b’s ball, first-and-10 on b7. illegal low block by b4. the restriction on team b begins at the snap. this is a post-possession foul. a.r. 12.50 low block team a—punt fourth-and-2 on a45. team a lines up in a punt formation. right guard a7 blocks b4 low (a) immediately after the snap, or (b) after the punt. b1 fair catches the punt at the b14. rulings: (a) b’s ball, first-and-10 on b14. no foul. team a’s restriction against blocking low begins after the punt and the low block occurs inside the tight end box. (b) b’s ball, first-and-10 on b29 or a’s ball, fourth-and-17 on a30. illegal low block after the punt. note: the restriction against blocking below the waist during a down in which there is a punt, begins after the snap for team b, but not until after the punt for team a. a.r. 12.51 low block team b—blocked punt fourth-and-5 on 50. b1 blocks the punt which goes to the a34 where a2 attempts to recover. b2 blocks a2 below the waist from the side at the a32 just prior to b1 recovering the ball and running to the a15, where he is downed. ruling: a’s ball, first-and-10 on b35. blocking below the waist is prohibited by the receiving team during a down in which there is a kick or change of possession. this is not a post-possession foul, because the kick did not cross the line of scrimmage, so enforcement is from the previous spot with an automatic first down. a.r. 12.52 punt—team b pushing teammate into opponent fourth-and-20 on 50. team a lines up a in punt formation. at the snap, b1 and b2 push down-lineman b3 into the center in an attempt to block the punt. a2’s punt goes out of bounds at the b15. ruling: a’s ball, first-and-10 on b35. team b cannot push a teammate into the offensive formation during a down in which there is a scrimmage kick formation, and it is a foul whether there is a kick or not. this is not a post-possession foul, because it is an attempt to block the kick, so enforcement is from the previous spot with an automatic first down. a.r. 12.53 low block team b—free kick a1 kicks off from the a35. during the return, b2 contacts a3 below the waist at the knees at the b30. the kickoff is returned to the 50.

they are therefore enforced from the previous spot. on scrimmage kick plays, team b players cannot block below the waist from the time of the snap until the end of the down; team a players cannot block below the waist from the time of the kick until the end of the down. a.r. 12.56 low block team b—field-goal formation—kick is not made fourth-and-4 on b23. holder a2 muffs the snap and attempts to run for a first down. he is tackled at the b20. at the snap, b4 blocked guard a6 below the waist. 82 ruling: b’s ball, first-and-10 on b20. this block is legal since there was no kick made during the down. a.r. 12.57 low block— double change of possession third-and-2 on a45. b5 intercepts a pass at the b10 and runs to the b20 where he fumbles. a3 recovers and runs the ball into the end zone for a touchdown. a4 blocked b5 below the waist from the front at the b10 during a3’s run. ruling: a’s ball, first-and-10 on b25. neither team may block below the waist after a change of possession. a.r. 12.58 low block—team a—outside the tight end box—pass second-and-10 on b45. wide receiver a4 is flexed four yards outside tackle a5, and slot back a2 is positioned one yard to the inside of a4. following the snap and prior to the pass, a4 hesitates as slot back a2 fires out and blocks cornerback b2 who is pressing a4. the block, which is below the waist and away from the ball, springs a4 on an inside slant route. a4 catches the pass and scores. ruling: a’s ball, second-and-25 on a40. illegal block below the waist because the low block occurs outside the tight end box. this would also be offensive pass interference by a2 if the contact occurred more than one yard beyond the line of scrimmage. a.r. 12.59 chop block (one man)—lure second-and-5 on b40. quarterback a1 drops back to pass and a5 sets up to pass block, but he does not make contact with the defensive player. a6 is adjacent to a5. as a5 shows pass block, a6 blocks the defensive player in front of a5 in the area of the thigh or lower. the pass is complete to a4 for a touchdown, and: (a) a5 is the offensive tackle and a6 is the tight end; (b) a5 is the center and a6 is the left guard; or (c) a5 is the tight end and a6 is the wing back. rulings: in (a), (b), and (c): second-and-20 on a45. this is an illegal “lure” chop block. anytime an offensive player sets up to block in a fashion that “lures” the defender, it is a chop block when another offensive player then immediately blocks that defender below the waist. this applies to all type plays - run, pass, or kick. a.r. 12.60 chop block – lure on run, pass, kick second-and-10 on b40. at the snap, right tackle a2 retreats a step and sets up to block b2, who is across from him. as b2 starts forward, right guard a3 blocks b2 below the waist. a2 never makes contact with b2. this occurs (a) on a pass play, (b) on a running play, or (c) on a kick play. team a gains a first down on the play. rulings: (a), (b), (c): second-and-25 on a45. anytime an offensive player sets up to block in a fashion that “lures” the defender, it is a chop block when another offensive player then immediately blocks that defender below the waist. this applies to all type plays - run, pass, or kick. a.r. 12.61 chop block—run third-and-5 on a40. quarterback a1 hands off to back a2 who runs wide around right end to the 50. while tackle a5 is contacting b5, wing back a3 blocks b5 in the area of the thigh at the line of scrimmage. the block occurred: (a) at the normal position of the tight end;

(b) a’s ball, first-and-10 on a30 (unsportsmanlike conduct). the use of any act that depicts violence or use of a weapon is always unsportsmanlike conduct. since this foul is not directed at a player, official, or team personnel, it is not of the type that could lead to disqualification for a second such foul. 87 a.r. 12.97 field goal formation—leverage—jumping between offensive linemen fourth-and-6 on b22. during a field-goal attempt, b2 places one hand on the snapper and one on the right guard and pushes off to jump thru the gap between the guard and center. he lands in the offensive backfield and then jumps up in an attempt to block the kick.

(12-3-1-t) note: if the field goal had been successful despite b3’s action, it is still a foul if b3 touched the ball; the field goal would count, and a would kick off from the 50, or team a could elect to take the points off the board, and it would be a 1-10-b15. if there was no contact with the ball, it is not a foul. a.r. 12.106 player removing his helmet third-and-10 on b20. a2 runs for a touchdown, and after scoring, removes his helmet: (a) in the end zone and turns to the crowd and glares; or (b) in the end zone, however he makes no unusual expressions and simply jogs back to his bench carrying his helmet. rulings: (a) and (b): touchdown. unsportsmanlike conduct. both team a and b have the option of enforcing fouls by their opponent on the try or kickoff. players are not allowed to remove their helmets on the field except in the situations designated in the rulebook. the actions taken by the player after removing his helmet are irrelevant in determining whether the action is a foul. a.r. 12.107 player removing his helmet—team a or b third-and-10 on b20. a2 runs and is tackled by b2 at the b15.

(b) first-and-goal on b7½. unsportsmanlike conduct. a.r. 12.108 player removing his helmet—foul by opponent second-and-10 on a40. back a2 runs to the a49 where he is tackled by the facemask by b1. after being tackled, a2 jumps up off the ground and immediately removes his helmet and glares at b1. ruling: second-and-10 on a40. replay the down because of the double fouls for facemask and unsportsmanlike conduct. if the contact by b1 had significantly altered the position of a2’s helmet, he would be able to remove and adjust it without a foul. a.r. 12.109 player from bench area removing his helmet after a touchdown, a player from the bench comes on the field to congratulate his teammate in the end zone. upon entering the field, the player takes his helmet off to celebrate with his teammates in the end zone, and he then (a) stays in the game for the try after putting his helmet back on, or (b) leaves the field and does not participate in the try. rulings: (a) and (b). touchdown. kickoff a35. no foul. it is a foul if a coach, team staff member, or player who is not in uniform, enters the playing field. but this player is in uniform, so the action is legal. 89 a.r. 12.110 foul against official—physical contact fourth-and-10 on 50. punter a1 muffs the snap and is downed at the a35. b2 clips a2 after the play has ended (dead-ball foul). upset that a foul was called, b2 pushes the field judge. ruling: b’s ball, first-and-25 on b35. disqualify b2. this is not a multiple foul, because all fouls against officials are enforced as fouls between downs. both fouls are therefore enforced, though team b will have the ball, because both fouls occurred during the dead ball period. a.r. 12.111 foul against official—physical contact fourth-and-2 on b35. a1 runs to the b34 where he is tackled. immediately after he is tackled, a1 jumps up and yells at the line judge arguing that he was tackled by the facemask. in the process, he bumps the official. ruling: b’s ball, first-and-10 on b49. disqualify a1. all fouls against officials are enforced, and they are enforced as fouls between downs. a.r. 12.112 foul against official—verbal abuse second-and-2 on b25. a1 runs to the b20 where he is tackled by the facemask. a1 jumps up and yells at the umpire, because he didn’t think the foul had been called (although it had). ruling: first-and-goal on b25. both fouls, unsportsmanlike conduct and facemask, are enforced, and the foul against the official is treated as a foul between downs, thus resulting in first-and-goal. two violations of 12-3-1 (a) through (c) in the same game results in an automatic disqualification. a.r. 12.113 last play of half—foul against official third-and-10 on b45. a1 passes to a2 at the b10 where b2 is guarding him closely. the side judge calls offensive pass interference. when b2 sees the flag, he thinks the foul was called on him, and he kicks the flag, or throws his helmet down, clearly to dispute the call. time in the first half expires on the play. ruling: half over. fifteen-yard penalty enforced against team b on the second-half kickoff. the offensive foul on the last play of the half results in the end of the half. the foul against the official is treated as a foul between downs. it therefore does not offset the pass interference, and it is enforced on the second half kickoff. b2 is not disqualified because he did not contact the official and did not throw his helmet at the official. however, a second violation of 12-3-1 (a) through (c) in the same game would result in an automatic disqualification. a.r. 12.114 throwing ball at official first-and-ten on b12. back a2 takes a handoff from qba1 and runs for a touchdown, after which, he spikes the ball in the end zone away from players. b7 becomes upset because he felt the ball was spiked near him, and there was no flag thrown. b7 picks up the ball and deliberately throws it at the field judge: (a) hitting the field judge; or (b) missing him with the ball. rulings: (a) and (b) touchdown team a, and they have the option to enforce the unsportsmanlike conduct penalty on the try or the ensuing kickoff. disqualify b7. the player is disqualified whether or not the ball hits the official. a.r. 12.115 timeout on field-goal attempt—attempting to freeze kicker fourth-and-10 on b22. when team a breaks the huddle to attempt a field goal, b1 calls a timeout. after the timeout, b2 then attempts to call another timeout to freeze the kicker. the officials ignore the second request, and: (a) the field goal is good; or (b) the attempt fails. rulings: (a) option: field goal good. kickoff 50 or a’s ball, first-and-10 on b11 (take the points off the board). (b) a’s ball, first-and-10 on b11. the officials properly ignored the second request and did not stop the game. the unsportsmanlike penalty is deemed to occur on the play as a live ball foul. (same ruling on a try attempt). note: if the officials mistakenly grant the request, the 15-yard penalty is enforced as a dead ball foul. a.r. 12.116 foul during halftime or overtime intermission as the teams are walking to the locker room at the end of the first half, or while awaiting the overtime coin toss, a1: (a) punches; or (b) taunts b1. rulings: (a) and (b): the 15-yard penalty will be assessed against team a on the succeeding kickoff. a1 would also be disqualified for the punch. the taunt is a violation of 12-3-1 (a) through (c), and two such penalties in the same game results in an automatic disqualification. legal/illegal bat/kick a.r. 12.117 illegal bat—backward pass—forward bat—team a third-and-4 on a40. quarterback a1 pitches the ball backward to running back a2 at the a35. a2 bats the ball in flight out of bounds at the a43. ruling: fourth-and-14 on a30. illegally batting (or kicking) the ball by the offense on a scrimmage play, (other than a scrimmage kick beyond the line), is a 10-yard penalty and a loss of down. since this foul occurred behind the line, the enforcement spot is the previous spot. if this foul occurred inside two minutes of either half, there would also be an option to run 10 seconds off the game clock. a.r. 12.118 two-point try attempt—backward pass——illegal bat—team a on a two-point try from the b2, quarterback a1 pitches the ball backward toward back a2. a2 bats the ball in flight into the end zone where a3 falls on the ball. 90 ruling: try fails, kickoff a35. the penalty for an illegal bat in this situation includes a loss of down, so the try fails and the penalty yardage is not enforced on the kickoff. (12-5-1-c) a.r. 12.119 illegal bat—controlled pass thrown forward second-and-6 on b40. end a3 leaps in the air to catch a pass and controls the ball at the b35. while in the air, he flips the ball forward to a4, and: (a) a4 runs for a touchdown; or (b) a4 muffs the ball and it hits the ground. rulings: (a) and (b): third-and-16 on 50. a controlled pass in flight can only be thrown backward; this is an illegal bat. enforcement is from the previous spot with a loss of down. (12-5-1-c-note) a.r. 12.120 illegal bat—blocked punt—team b fourth and-12 on a14. the punt is blocked and the ball rolls to the a4 where b2 bats the ball (giving it new impetus). the ball rolls over the end line. ruling: a’s ball, first-and-10 on a24. since the punted ball did not go beyond the line of scrimmage, this is not a post-possession foul, and the illegal bat is enforced from the previous spot with an automatic first down. the result of the play is a touchback because team b’s impetus put the ball through the end zone, but enforcement of the penalty is more advantageous for team a. a.r. 12.121 illegal bat—punt—ball hits team b player fourth-and-10 on a40. a1 bats the rolling kick at the b14 into b5 who is at the b12. the ball rebounds off b5 and goes into b’s end zone where it is recovered by a3. ruling: b’s ball, first-and-10 on b30, or a’s ball fourth-and-20 on a30. the illegal bat results in a touchback. if the previous spot enforcement option is selected, there is no loss of down, because this occurs beyond the line of scrimmage during a scrimmage kick. note: the illegal bat can be enforced from the previous spot or the dead-ball spot, but since b5 is not deemed to have touched the ball, the result of the play is a touchback when the ball hits in the end zone untouched by team b. batting the ball creates a new impetus, so although it makes no difference on this play, the impetus that put the ball in the end zone is the bat, not the kick. a.r. 12.122 illegal bat—end zone fourth-and-10 on a2. runner a1 fumbles at the a1. the ball goes into the team a end zone where a2 bats it out of bounds: (a) in the end zone; (b) on the two-yard line; or (c) to a3 who recovers the ball in the end zone. rulings: safety in (a), (b), and (c). safety kick a20. in (b), team b can decline the penalty and take the result of the play, b’s ball first-and-goal on a1. a player may not bat a loose ball (other than a pass in flight) in any direction in the end zone. this is a foul even if the player is attempting to keep the ball in bounds. there is no option to enforce the foul from the previous spot. a.r. 12.123 legal/illegal bat—backward pass—end zone involvement first-and-10 on a2. quarterback a1 throws a backward pass to a3 in the end zone, and: (a) b1, while in the end zone, bats the backward pass while in flight over the end line; or (b) b1, while in the end zone, bats the grounded backward pass after a3 muffs the pass. the ball goes out of bounds at the a4. rulings: (a) safety. safety kick a20. legal bat. (b) a’s ball, first-and-10 on a12. illegal bat. a.r. 12.124 legal bat—pass in end zone second-and-goal on b6. runner a1 runs to his right and passes the ball forward from the b7 to a2 in the end zone. a2 bats the ball forward to a3 who catches the ball in the end zone. ruling: touchdown team a. kickoff a35. a forward pass in flight may be batted, tipped, or deflected in any direction by any eligible player at any time. a.r. 12.125 bat to prevent ball from going out of bounds second-and-10 on b45. a1 runs to the b40 where he fumbles near the sideline. the ball is about to go out of bounds when b1 bats the ball toward the field of play, and b2 eventually recovers at the b35. b1 batted the ball: (a) toward team a’s goal line; or (b) toward his own goal line. rulings: (a) a’s ball, first-and-10 on b30. this is an illegal bat, and the 10-yard penalty is enforced from the spot of the fumble. (b) b’s ball, first-and-10 on b35. the bat was backward so it was legal. illegally kicking ball a.r. 12.126 illegal kicking of ball in possession third-and-6 on b41. quarterback a1 hands off to back a2 who runs to the b36. as he is being tackled, a2 stretches his arms out with the ball extending out over the b35. prior to being down by contact, b2 kicks the ball out of a2’s hands and falls on the ball. ruling: a’s ball, first-and-10 on b25. no player may deliberately kick any loose ball or a ball in player possession. a.r. 12.127 field-goal attempt—beyond line fourth-and-3 on b25. field-goal kicker a1 runs to the b23 and drop-kicks the ball over the crossbar. 91 ruling: b’s ball, first-and-10 on b20. touchback. decline the penalty, which would be enforced from the spot of the foul, and the down would be replayed, since the drop kick occurred beyond the line of scrimmage. a drop kick, place kick, or punt from beyond the line of scrimmage is not illegally kicking the ball and therefore does not include a loss of down. a.r. 12.128 illegal kicking after change of possession third-and-2 on a45. b1 intercepts a pass on the b15, runs to the a35, fumbles, and then kicks the ball out of bounds at the a5 to prevent a2 from recovering. ruling: b’s ball, first-and-10 on a45. the foul is enforced from the spot of the fumble as a foul during a backward pass or fumble. there is not a loss of down, because this occurred after a change of possession. a.r. 12.129 illegal kicking—loose ball (backward pass)—behind line fourth-and-10 on a40. the snap from center is muffed, and punter a1 never controls the ball. a1 then kicks the ball while it is on the ground at the a30, and the ball rolls to the b48 where a3 falls on it. ruling: b’s ball, first-and-10 on a30. enforce from the previous spot with a loss of down. a.r. 12.130 illegal kicking - punt beyond line fourth-and-10 on a40. a1’s punt is short and is rolling untouched at the b45. running downfield, a1 kicks the rolling ball out of frustration, and it goes out of bounds at the b20.. ruling: b’s ball, first-and-10 on b45, or a fourth-and-20 on a30. this is a foul during a scrimmage kick, so team b’s options are to add the penalty to the end of the play, enforce it from the previous spot, or take the ball at the first touch spot. if the penalty is accepted, there is no loss of down, because this is illegal kicking beyond the line during a scrimmage kick. a.r. 12.131 illegal kicking—fourth-down fumble—behind line fourth-and-5 on b15. on a field-goal attempt, the snap is caught by a2 at the b23, but a2 fumbles the ball before a1 can kick the field goal. while the ball is loose on the ground, the kicker kicks the ball to prevent b2 from recovering it. the ball goes out of bounds at the b11. ruling: b’s ball, first-and-10 on b25. this is illegal kicking of a loose ball, which is enforced from the previous spot with a loss of down. a.r. 12.132 accidental kicking of loose ball fourth-and-12 on a14. the punt is partially blocked and the ball rolls to the a6. b1 tries to pick it up there but accidentally kicks it into the end zone where b3 falls on it. ruling: touchdown team b. kickoff b35. only the deliberate kicking of a loose ball is a foul. accidental kicking or batting does not create a new impetus. rule 13 non-player conduct a.r. 13.1 substitute shoves runner after he is out of bounds second-and-5 on 50. runner a1 goes out of bounds in the team b bench area at the b45. substitute b12 shoves a1 to the ground out of bounds. ruling: a’s ball, first-and-10 on b30. unsportsmanlike conduct by b12. penalize from the succeeding spot. disqualify b12 if the action is flagrant, (but this action is not the type that counts toward a future disqualification for similar conduct). even though there is contact, which is normally unnecessary roughness, the foul was by a player not in the game at the time, so it is penalized as unsportsmanlike conduct. a.r. 13.2 head coach comes on field—confronts official second-and-10 on b30. upset when the line judge rules a forward pass is incomplete at the b15, a’s head coach runs onto the field at the b15-yard line to calmly discuss the ruling with the line judge. ruling: third-and-25 on b45. unsportsmanlike conduct. penalize 15 yards from the succeeding spot. a.r. 13.3 head coach comes on field too far from bench area third-and-10 on b30. a1’s pass falls incomplete at the b18 near the team b sideline. the team a head coach comes onto the field near the numbers to yell at the side judge on the opposite side of the field that he missed a defensive holding call. ruling: fourth-and-25 on b45. unsportsmanlike conduct. no coach can come into the field of play to address a game official. officials will have discretion to warn if the coach comes onto the field a yard or two to get their attention. a.r. 13.4 non-player shoves official third-and-8 on a45. quarterback a1 throws a pass to a2 near the sideline. the line judge rules the pass incomplete. as the teams line up for the next play, a non-playing member of team a, a4, pushes the down judge. ruling: fourth-and-23 on a30. unsportsmanlike conduct by non-playing personnel. disqualify a4. a.r. 13.5 non-player in six-foot border—contact with official third-and-5 on a30. an injured team a player, in street clothes and wearing an appropriate credential, stands in the six-foot, solid-white border next to the sideline and accidentally trips the field judge at the 50 who is covering a long run to the b20. 92 ruling: a’s ball, first-and-10 on b35. the unsportsmanlike conduct penalty is enforced as a dead ball foul. if the action affected the outcome of the play in any way, the referee will enforce a 15-yard penalty from the spot that he and the crew deem most equitable, including awarding/negating a score. a.r. 13.6 non-player in six-foot border—contact with player third-and-5 on b40. on the last play of the game with the score tied and no timeouts left for either team, qba1 hands off to a2 who runs wide and down the sideline. a2 is at the b30 when he collides with a team b player from the bench area who is standing on his sideline. a2 fumbles and a3 recovers at the b20. a2 is injured on the play. ruling: a’s ball, first-and-10 on b15 for an untimed down (a2 could remain in the game), or the referee may award a touchdown if he and the crew feel that is equitable. a.r. 13.7 contact with coach in six-foot border first-and-10 on a30. the side judge is covering a long run in front of a’s bench area when he runs into team a’s head coach who is standing in the six-foot, solid-white border at the 50-yard line. the side judge is knocked to the ground. team a scores. ruling: touchdown team a. team b has the option to enforce the foul on the try or the kickoff. unsportsmanlike conduct. the foul is enforced as a dead ball foul. if the action affected the outcome of the play in any way the referee will enforce a 15-yard penalty from the spot that he and the crew deem most equitable, including awarding/negating a score. a.r. 13.8 contact with team b coach in six-foot border—team a also fouls third-and-10 on a45. a1 throws a swing pass to back a2 at the b45. a2 runs down the sideline to the b20 where he is tackled. the side judge, while covering the play, is knocked to the ground by a team b assistant in the restricted white-border area, outside the team b bench area. during a2’s run, a7 held b3 at the b30. ruling: third-and-10 on a45. the dead ball unsportsmanlike conduct combines with the live ball hold to create a double foul. the fouls offset at the previous spot and the down is replayed. a.r. 13.9 substitute comes on field during play—recovers fumble third-and-5 on b45. runner a1 fumbles at the b35. (a) substitute b12 comes off the bench and recovers the ball; or (b) substitute a12 comes off the bench and recovers the ball, at the b33. rulings: (a) a’s ball, first-and-10 on b20. palpably unfair act by b12. the referee will enforce a 15-yard penalty from the spot that he and the crew deem most equitable. team a retains the ball. disqualify b12.

onto the field, pushes b2 away, and recovers the ball at the b40. ruling: b’s ball, first-and-10 on a45. palpably unfair act. the referee will enforce a 15-yard penalty from the spot that he and the crew deem most equitable. disqualify a12. a.r. 13.12 substitute comes on field during play—tackles runner a1 is on his way to an apparent touchdown when b12 comes off his bench to tackle a1 at the b30. ruling: touchdown team a, and they also have the option to enforce the 15 yard penalty on the try or the kickoff. palpably unfair act. the game officials should allow the play to continue to its conclusion and then penalize team b. if it is clear that a1 would have scored, the referee will award the touchdown. disqualify b12. a.r. 13.13 contact with official by coach/player during halftime/going to overtime after the end of the first half (or second half if the game is going into overtime), a team a coach or player contacts an official while arguing with him as they leave the

coach/player. the officials’ jurisdiction continues during intermissions. a.r. 13.14 officials’ jurisdiction begins one hour and 40 minutes prior to kickoff while the teams are warming up 30 minutes before the game, a1 punches b1 on the field. ruling: team a will be assessed a 15-yard unnecessary roughness on the opening kickoff, and a1 is disqualified. the officials’ jurisdiction starts when the pregame security meeting takes place approximately 100 minutes before kickoff, and all unnecessary roughness/unsportsmanlike conduct rules take effect at that time. 93 a.r. 13.15 substitute leaves bench area during play—enters field to celebrate after play third-and-10 on a40. receiver a4 catches a pass near the sideline at the 50, breaks a tackle, and has a clear path to the end zone. substitute a13, not wearing a helmet, runs down the sideline (just outside the white) parallel with the runner all the way to the end zone. after a4 scores, a13 runs into the end zone and jumps on a4’s back to celebrate, and then high fives other teammates before returning to the bench. ruling: touchdown team a. team b has the option to enforce the 15 yard penalty on the try or the kickoff. it is unsportsmanlike conduct for a substitute, coach or any team personnel to be out of the team bench area during the play. that penalty will be enforced on the try or ensuing kickoff. there is no prohibition against uniformed substitutes coming onto the field to celebrate after the play, if they comply with normal celebration rules. further, the rules against a player removing his helmet do not apply to substitutes coming off the bench. this unsportsmanlike conduct foul is not one that could lead to a disqualification. a.r. 13.16 non-uniformed players leave the team bench area to celebrate after td third-and-10 on a40. qb a1 throws a pass to a2 who catches the ball and scores a touchdown. after a2 scores, uniformed and non-uniformed players and coaches or other team personnel run onto the field and surround a2 in the end zone to celebrate. ruling: touchdown team a. team b has the option to enforce the 15 yard penalty on the try or the kickoff. it is legal for teammates who are dressed in uniform to leave the bench area to celebrate after a score, but it is a 15-yard unsportsmanlike conduct foul for players who are not in uniform, coaches, or other team personnel to come onto the field to celebrate. this would not be they type of foul that qualifies toward disqualification for two such fouls, unless the coach or staff member directs his actions toward an opponent. a.r. 13.17 coach or team staff member leaves the team bench area to celebrate after td third-and-10 on a40. qb a1 throws a pass to a2 who catches the ball and scores a touchdown. after a2 scores, a team a coach or team staff member runs down the sideline and celebrates with a2 in the end zone. ruling: touchdown team a. team b has the option to enforce the 15 yard penalty on the try or the kickoff. it is unsportsmanlike conduct if any coach or team staff member leaves the bench area to participate in a celebration. this would not be they type of foul that qualifies toward disqualification for two such fouls, unless the coach or staff member directs his actions toward an opponent. a.r. 13.18 fg attempt—snow being cleared from field fourth-and-10 on b30. team a calls a timeout to prepare for a fg in snowy conditions. during the timeout, (a) players begin clearing snow from the area the kick will be made, using only their hands and feet; or (b) team personnel or grounds crew begin clearing snow from the same area. rulings: (a) no foul. players may help clear snow, using only their hands or feet (no towels, etc.) (b) fourth-and-25 on b45. unsportsmanlike conduct. it is impermissible for the grounds crew or other team personnel to clear away snow for a try, field goal, punt, or kickoff. officials should try to prevent this as soon as they see someone coming out on the field, thus avoiding the need to call a penalty. a.r. 13.19 bench personnel enters field of play—snap occurs—does not interfere second-and-five on a40. before the snap, a team b attendant runs onto the field to grab a towel that fell off a player. while he is on the field behind the offense, the ball is snapped, and a1 throws an incomplete pass. the action by the attendant did not affect the outcome of the play. ruling: third-and-five on a40. since the movement onto the field did not affect the play, there is no penalty. if there is any question in a game official’s mind that the movement could affect the play, the game official should blow the whistle immediately and kill the play. if the action affected the outcome of the play, in any way, the referee will enforce a 15-yard penalty from the spot that the referee and the crew deem most equitable, including awarding or negating a score. a.r. 13.20 substitute enters field from his bench area before/after the snap third-and-10 on 50. substitute b3 is attempting to get on the field of play as the eleventh defensive player. a1 throws an incomplete pass on the play: (a) b11 is stepping on the defensive side of the ball with his right foot on the field, but his left foot does not touch in the field of play before the snap. he then continues onto the field. (b) b11 steps on the field with both feet, but he is on the offensive side of the ball when the ball is snapped. rulings: (a) a’s ball, third-and-5 on b45. illegal substitution. to be legally on the field, an incoming substitute must get both feet or body part other than a hand or foot down prior to the snap, or it is illegal substitution. depending on the action taken by the player as the play develops, a 5 or 15-yard penalty could be assessed.

(b) b’s ball, first-and-10 on b28. illegal use of hands. during the return, team a has become the defense, so illegal use of hands by team a is a five-yard penalty. a.r. 14.29 kickoff—foul by team a during kick as an onside kick from the a35 is rolling at the a46, a1 blocks b1 on the a43. after a1’s block, b2 picks up the ball on the a44 and runs it back to the a20. 97 ruling: b’s ball, first-and-goal on a10. illegal blocking or use of hands during a free kick. team a may not block within 10 yards of its restraining line until the ball is legally touched. the location of the ball at the time of the block is irrelevant. team a fouls before the change of possession on a free kick can be enforced from the dead-ball spot, as long as team b retains possession throughout the down. note: additional plays involving penalty enforcement during free kick plays are in rule 6 of the casebook. fouls during scrimmage kicks a.r. 14.30 double foul—team a failure to report/team b offside fourth-and-10 on a30. tackle a3 enters the game, goes into the huddle without reporting, and takes a wingback position in a punt formation. after the punt, b1 muffs the ball on the b30 and a2 recovers it there. b2 was offside. ruling: fourth-and-10 on a30. illegal formation by team a for a player wearing an ineligible number playing an eligible position without reporting. also, defensive offside. the penalties offset. a.r. 14.31 first touch—team b foul—during kick/return fourth-and-6 on a40. a1 is the first to touch the punt on the b24. b1 recovers at the b18 and runs to the b30. b2 held on the b45: (a) during the punt; or (b) during the run by b1. rulings: (a) b’s ball, first-and-10 on b9. offensive holding. the post-possession foul is enforced from the end of the kick, because that is behind the spot of b’s foul. the enforcement of b’s foul negates the first touch. (b) b’s ball, first-and-10 on b20. offensive holding. the penalty is enforced from the dead-ball spot, since the foul occurred during the run, and the run ended behind the spot of the foul. a.r. 14.32 first touch—team b foul—offside/pushing teammate fourth-and-10 on a45. a1 first touches and downs the punt on the b10: (a) b1 was offside; or (b) b2 pushed his teammate from behind into the right guard at the snap. rulings: (a) b’s ball, first-and-10 on b10, if team a declines the defense offside; or a’s ball, fourth-and-5 on 50. (b) a’s ball, first-and-10 on b40. unnecessary roughness for pushing a teammate into the offensive formation on a scrimmage kick or try. this foul is enforced from the previous spot. a.r. 14.33 first touch—team b foul—during punt/return—fumble fourth-and-15 on a10. a3 first touches the punt at the 50. b1 recovers at the b40 and fumbles at the a35, where a2 recovers. b2 held on the a30: (a) during the punt; or (b) during the run by b1. rulings: (a) a’s ball, fourth-and-5 on a20. since team b lost possession during the down, this is not a post possession foul. the holding penalty is therefore enforced from the previous spot, and with the enforcement of a foul, the first touch violation is eliminated. the holding foul is a 10-yard penalty (with no automatic first down) because it occurred during a kick that went beyond the line (9-1-4(d)). team a can also decline the penalty, thus giving team b the ball at the spot of first touch. (b) b’s ball, first-and-10 on 50 (spot of first touch). as this foul was during the return, it is a foul on a running play, with enforcement from the spot of the foul, (a30), or the end of the run, (a35). if team a accepts b’s holding penalty, it will be enforced from the a35, resulting in b’s ball, first-and-10 on a45. team a will therefore decline the penalty, and b will take the ball at the first touch spot, the 50. a.r. 14.34 first touch—run and fumble—team b fouls—before/after touchdown by team a fourth-and-3 on a45. a1 first touches the punt on the b10. b1 recovers on the b4 and fumbles on the b8. a2 recovers and runs into b’s end zone. during a2’s run, b2 grabbed and twisted a2’s facemask on the b6: (a) before; or (b) after a2 crossed the goal line. rulings: (a) touchdown team a. team a has the option to enforce the foul on the try or the kickoff. when a accepts the live ball foul, the first touching violation is negated by the foul. if b’s foul was not a personal foul or unsportsmanlike conduct foul, there would be no enforcement option for the non-major foul because the dead-ball spot is in the end zone, so the foul would be declined by rule and team b would be awarded the ball at the first touch spot. (b) b’s ball, first-and-10 on b5. facemask. when team a crosses the goal line, and there hasn’t been a live-ball foul on the play, the first touch spot is used to give b the ball. the dead-ball foul is then enforced from the succeeding spot, the b10 (the first touch spot). a.r. 14.35 scrimmage kick – first touch – team b advances – dead ball foul by team b fourth-and-10 on a40. a1’s punt is rolling at the b20 where it is touched by a3, b1 picks up the punt on the b15 and runs to the b12 where he is tackled. immediately after the play is over, b2 shoves a4 to the ground. ruling: b’s ball, first-and-10 b10. first touch and unnecessary roughness. since there was a “first touch” by team a, b has the option of taking the ball at that spot of first touching, with the dead ball foul enforced from that spot. while the enforcement of a live ball foul eliminates the ability to take the ball at the first touch spot, the enforcement of dead ball fouls, (by either team), does not eliminate that option. 98 a.r. 14.36 double foul—invalid fair catch signal/kick catch interference—change of possession fourth-and-10 on a40. a1 punts the ball, and b1 gives an invalid fair-catch signal at the b20. b1 is in position to catch the ball when it hits a2 in the air at the b21. b1 then picks up the ball at the b15 and runs to the b40 where he fumbles and a2 recovers. ruling: a’s ball, fourth-and-10 on a40. invalid fair catch signal and interference with the opportunity to catch a kick. since team b did not retain possession, the fouls offset and the down is replayed. a.r. 14.37 double foul with a change—invalid fair catch signal/kick catch interference fourth-and-10 on 50. b1 gives an invalid fair-catch signal as he waits to catch the punt at the b20. a1 bumps b1 before the punted ball arrives, but b1 catches the ball anyway at the b20. ruling: b’s ball, first-and-10 on b15, or team b has the option to replay. invalid fair catch signal and interference with the opportunity to catch a kick. double foul with a change of possession. a.r. 14.38 team b foul during kick—touchback fourth-and-10 on a40. the punt rolls out of bounds in the end zone. during the punt, there is a foul by b1 at the b12. the foul is: (a) clipping by b1 at the b12; or (b) blocking by b1 at the b12 after giving a fair-catch signal at the b14. rulings: (a) b’s ball, first-and-10 on b6. clipping. since the foul was inside the b20, it is enforced from the spot of the foul. (b) b’s ball, first-and-10 on b6. blocking after giving a fair catch signal is a spot foul. a.r. 14.39 team b foul during punt—kick ends in end zone fourth-and-10 on 50. during the punt, b1 commits an illegal block in the back at the b40. b2 catches the punt in the end zone and returns it to the 50 where he is tackled. ruling: b’s ball, first-and-10 on b10. illegal block in the back. since the kick ended in the end zone, the foul is enforced from the end of the kick (b20), as that is behind the spot of the foul. a.r. 14.40 team b foul in end zone during punt fourth-and-10 on 50. during the punt, b1 clips a2 in the end zone. the punt goes out of bounds at the b6. ruling: b’s ball, first-and-10 on b3. clipping. this is not a safety because team b did not run with the ball. when a post-possession foul occurs in the endzone, it is deemed to have occurred at the 20-yard line if team a is responsible for the ball entering team b’s end zone. the penalty is enforced from the end of the kick, as that spot is behind the spot of the foul. a.r. 14.41 team a illegally kicking a blocked punt—in field of play/end zone fourth-and-10 on a10. a1’s punt is blocked, and a1 kicks the rolling ball off the ground: (a) at the a2; or (b) from three yards deep in the end zone. the ball goes out of bounds at the a25. rulings: (a) b’s ball, first-and-goal on a5. illegally kicking a loose ball. since the penalty occurred behind the line of scrimmage, in the field of play, it is enforced from the previous spot, with a loss of down. (b) safety, safety kick a20, or b’s ball, first-and-10 on a25 (declining the penalty). there is no option to enforce from the dead-ball spot unless it is a personal foul or unsportsmanlike conduct foul. a.r. 14.42 punt—invalid fair-catch signal—kicker out of bounds fourth-and-15 on b48. b1 gives an invalid fair-catch signal at the b10-yard line. the punted ball is rolling on the ground near the sideline at the b1. flyer a1 avoids blocker b2 at the 15-yard line by going out of bounds. a1 re-establishes and downs the ball at the b1. ruling: a’s ball, fourth-and-15 on b48, or b’s ball, first-and-10 on b5. invalid fair catch signal by b1 (clean hands) and team a fouls for illegal touching of a kick and player going out of bounds during a punt. this is a double foul with a change of possession, so team b would most likely elect to replay the down. a.r. 14.43 team b foul—blocked kick fourth-and-15 on a35. a1’s punt is blocked behind the line of scrimmage and is recovered by b1 at the a30. during the kick, b2 tackled flyer a2 at the line of scrimmage. ruling: a’s ball, first-and-10 on a40. the foul by b2 is enforced as a defensive hold because the kick did not cross the line of scrimmage. note: additional plays involving penalty enforcement during scrimmage kick plays are in rule 9 of the casebook. fouls during a backward pass or fumble a.r. 14.44 team b foul during fumble—team a recovers their own fumble and advances first-and-10 on 50. a1 runs to the b40 and fumbles. during the loose ball, b1 grabs and pulls a1’s facemask in an effort to recover the ball. a2 recovers at the b35 and runs to the b20 where he is tackled. ruling: first-and-goal on b10. the facemask penalty is enforced half-the-distance from the dead-ball spot. a.r. 14.45 team a foul during fumble—team b recovers and advances first-and-10 on b40. a1 runs to the b35 where he fumbles. during the loose ball, a1 grabs and twists b1’s facemask at the b30. b2 recovers the ball at the b30 and runs to the 50 where he is tackled. 99 ruling: b’s ball, first-and-10 on a35. because the personal foul happened prior to the recovery of a fumble, (or backward pass or interception), the facemask penalty carries over and is tacked on to the dead ball spot. a.r. 14.46 team a foul behind/beyond line—during fumble behind the line second-and-5 on a40. a1 runs to the a38 where he fumbles. in the scramble during the loose ball, a2 grabs b2 and pulls him away from the ball (a2 makes no effort to recover the ball) at the: (a) a36; or (b) a42. a1 recovers the ball at the a45. rulings: in both (a) and (b), second-and-15 on a30. enforce the offensive holding from the previous spot. a.r. 14.47 team a foul behind/beyond line—during fumble beyond the line second-and-5 on a40. a1 runs to the a43 where he fumbles. in the scramble during the loose ball, a2 grabs b2 and pulls him away from the ball at the: (a) a36; (b) a42; or (c) a44. a2 makes no effort to recover the ball. a1 recovers the ball at the a45. rulings: (a) second-and-15 on a30. offensive holding. enforce from the previous spot.

(14-2-2-b) (b) safety. safety kick a10. since the play results in a safety, the facemask is not “used” to get the safety; it can be enforced on the ensuing free kick. a.r. 14.50 fumble in end zone—team b foul in field of play—team a’s impetus receiver b1 catches a free kick or punt, or intercepts a pass, in his end zone. while there and running with the ball, b1 fumbles, and the ball rolls to the b2 where b3 intentionally kicks it out of bounds at the b4. ruling: b’s ball, first-and-10 on b1. illegally kicking the ball. since a’s impetus put the ball in the end zone, where b1 intercepted and fumbled, the spot of the fumble is deemed to be the 20-yard line. team b fouled behind that spot, so enforcement is from the spot of the foul, the b2. a.r. 14.51 not momentum—team b fumble in end zone—foul by team a third-and-10 on b40. a1’s pass is intercepted by b1 at the b4, and his momentum carries him into the end zone where he scrambles to try and run it out. while he is running in the end zone, b1 fumbles, and the ball rolls out to the b5 where it is recovered by b1 and he is downed. during the fumble, while the ball was rolling in the field of play, a2 blocks b2 low (anywhere). ruling: b’s ball, first-and-10 on b20. illegal block below the waist. because team b has possession at the end of the down and there are no other fouls, the foul can be enforced from the dead-ball spot. team b would also have the option to enforce the foul from the spot of the fumble, which is the goal line on this play. momentum does not apply because the ball was not declared dead in the end zone in team b’s possession. 5 vs. 15 a.r. 14.52 double foul—team b offside—team a clip/hold second-and-5 on a30. runner a1 is downed on a36. b1 was offside. tackle a2: (a) held; or (b) clipped during the run. rulings: (a) second-and-5 on a30. replay. defense offside, and holding by the offense. (b) second-and-20 on a15; 5 vs. 15. defense offside and clipping by the offense. penalize from previous spot. a.r. 14.53 double dead ball fouls - after ready for play second-and-5 on b20. guard a2, after getting into a three-point stance, moves his legs abruptly. the officials blow the play dead, after which b1 grabs quarterback a1 and throws him to the ground. ruling: a’s ball, first-and-goal on b10. false start and unnecessary roughness. 5 vs. 15 enforcement applies since both dead ball fouls occurred after the ready for play. a.r. 14.54 runner spikes ball immediately after being tackled – team b commits a personal foul first-and-10-b20. runner a2 runs to the b8 yard line for a first down and immediately jumps up and spikes the ball toward the end zone. b3 is offended and knocks a2 down. 100 ruling: a first-and-goal b8. since both fouls were dead ball fouls after the play, there is no 5 vs.15 enforcement and the fouls offset at the dead ball spot. note: 5 vs.15 enforcement does apply to fouls after the ready for play and before the snap, but 5 vs.15 enforcement does not apply if the 5-yard and 15 yard penalties occur after the play ends and before the next ready for play. a.r. 14.55 multiple and double fouls third-and-3 on a28. a1 is illegally in motion at the snap. team a has six men on the line of scrimmage. a3 runs to the a40 where he is tackled by the facemask by b3. b4 was offside at the snap. ruling: a’s ball, first-and-10 on a43. team a, illegal motion and illegal formation; team b, offside and personal foul facemask. 5 vs. 15 enforcement applies if there is at least one 15-yard penalty by one team, and one or more simple 5’s by the other team. a.r. 14.56 double foul second-and-10 at a40. end a3 is legally chucked out of bounds at the a43. a3 immediately re-establishes at the a48 and leaps in an attempt to catch the pass. the pass goes off of a3’s fingers and, while a3 is defenseless, b3 launches and hits a3 helmet-to-helmet as the pass falls incomplete. ruling: second-and-10 on a40. illegal touch of a forward pass and unnecessary roughness. illegal touching of a forward pass by an eligible receiver who has been out of bounds is not a five-yard penalty, (loss of down only, so not a simple 5), so 5 vs. 15 enforcement does not apply. the penalties offset and the down is replayed. a.r. 14.57 double dead ball fouls—after two-minute warning second-and-10 on b30. one minute and twenty-five seconds remain in the game, and team b is ahead 17-14. the clock is running, and team a hurries to the ball, but a3 false starts. b1 comes across the line and body slams a1. ruling: second-and-10 on b30. false start and unnecessary roughness. there is no 5 vs. 15 enforcement, because the false start is not a “simple 5” due to the 10-second runoff portion of the foul. however, in this situation, since the penalties offset, there is no 10-second runoff, and the clock starts on the snap. a.r. 14.58 double dead ball fouls—after two-minute warning second-and-10 on b30. one minute and twenty-five seconds remain in the game, and team a is ahead 17-14 with the clock running. team a comes to the line, and b2 encroaches by making contact with guard a2. a2 takes exception and body slams b2. ruling: second-and-10 on b30. encroachment and unnecessary roughness. there is no 5 vs. 15 enforcement because the encroachment is not a “simple 5”, as this foul would require the play clock to be set to 40 seconds. however, in this situation, since there is a double foul, the play clock is set to 25 seconds, and the clock starts on the snap. a.r. 14.59 team b live ball personal foul—team a delay of game at end of play second-and-10 on a20. during a2’s run, b1 grabs center a3’s mask and pulls him to the ground. a2 runs to the (a) 50; or (b) a37. in celebration, a2 (while still on the ground, or after getting up) forcibly spikes the ball away from players in the field of play. rulings: (a) first-and-10 on a45. facemask and delay of game. team a has the option to decline the foul by b1 (which would be 5 vs. 15 enforcement, here) and allow their delay-of-game penalty to be enforced from the dead ball spot. (b) first-and-10 on a35. facemask and delay-of-game. team a’s better option here is to accept 5 vs.15 enforcement. (14-5-1-item 1.) note: when there is a double foul, and team a’s only foul is a dead ball spike delay-of- game at the end of the play, team a has the option whether to accept normal double foul enforcement, (replay the down, or 5 vs. 15 enforcement, if appropriate), or instead decline team b’s foul and just have their dead ball spike delay-of-game penalty enforced. a.r. 14.60 double dead ball fouls—after two-minute warning third-and-5 on b45. with 15 seconds left in a tied game, a1 scrambles to the b20 where he is tackled by b1, who continues to lie on top of a1, preventing him from getting off the ground. a2 then grabs b1’s facemask and pulls him off the pile to allow a1 to get up. ruling: first-and-10 on b20. delay of game defense and unnecessary roughness offense. dead-ball fouls by both teams offset at the succeeding spot. there is no 5 vs. 15 enforcement for dead-ball fouls at the end of a play. the clock starts on the snap. a.r. 14.61 kickoff—double foul—team a recovers kick beyond 10 yards on a kickoff from the a35, a1 pooches the ball directly up into the air. b1 gives an invalid fair-catch signal at the 50, where a2 contacts him before the ball arrives. a2 recovers the ball at the b45. ruling: re-kick a35. invalid fair catch signal and interference with the opportunity to catch a kick. there was no change of possession, but an invalid signal is a spot foul, so 5 vs. 15 enforcement does not apply. a.r. 14.62 team b live ball foul—team a foul between downs third-and-10 on a40. at the snap, b1 is offside. quarterback a1 throws a pass to a2 and the pass is ruled incomplete. end a2 takes off his helmet and argues with the back judge. 101 ruling: third-and-20 on a30. defense offside and dead ball unsportsmanlike conduct. both fouls are enforced separately as the unsportsmanlike foul against an official is treated as a foul between downs. (it also counts toward a disqualification for two such qualifying fouls in the game.) note: if the official had flagged a2 for simply taking his helmet off (rather than arguing with an official), the unsportsmanlike conduct foul would combine with the offside penalty to create a 5/15 enforcement. a.r. 14.63 team a signals for timeout when not permitted—play is run—team b personal foul second-and-12 on b40. team a is out of timeouts, but after all 11 players get set, a1 turns and asks the referee for a timeout. the referee ignores the request. a1 gets set again and takes the snap. he hands off to back a2 who runs out of bounds at the b36 where b2 hits him late. ruling: first-and-10 on b21. unnecessary roughness. there is no foul for delay of game, since the officials did not grant a1’s request. the late hit is enforced per normal rules. a.r. 14.64 team a signals for timeout when not permitted—granted—team b personal foul second-and-12 on b40. team a is out of timeouts, but after all 11 players get set, a1 turns and asks the referee for a timeout who incorrectly grants it. immediately following the whistle, b4 knocks center a8 to the ground. ruling: first-and-10 on b25. delay of game and unnecessary roughness. when the officials grant a timeout request from a team that is not legally permitted to take one, it is a penalty for delay of game. the unnecessary roughness by b4 combines with the delay of game to create a 5 vs.15 enforcement. if this occurred after the two-minute warning, with the clock running, the delay of game would not be a simple 5 because it would include a ten-second runoff. in that case, the fouls would offset at the previous spot. fouls prior to a change of possession a.r. 14.65 foul prior to fumble—double change of possession fourth-and-10 on a40. b1 catches the punt on the b25 and runs to the b35 where he fumbles. during b1’s run (before the fumble), b2 blocks a3 low at the b37. a2 recovers the fumble at the b34 and runs to the b33 where he fumbles, and b2 recovers and is downed at the b30. ruling: a’s ball, first-and-10 on b19. low block. enforce the low block foul from the spot of a2’s recovery, and give the ball back to team a. a.r. 14.66 foul prior to fumble—double change of possession fourth-and-10 on a40. b1 catches the punt on the b25 and runs to the b35 where he fumbles. during b1’s run: (a), b2 blocks a3 low at the b37; or b) b3 blocks a5 in the back at the b37. a2 recovers the fumble at the b34 and runs to the b33 where he fumbles, and a3 recovers and is downed at the b30. rulings: (a) a’s ball, first-and-10 on b15. b2’s low block is carried over the change of possession and enforced from the dead ball spot, since team a never lost possession after recovering b1’s fumble. (b) a’s ball, first-and-10 on b30. decline illegal block above the waist. only unnecessary roughness and unsportsmanlike conduct fouls can be carried over the change of possession. a.r. 14.67 personal foul prior to double change of possession fourth-and-10 on a40. b1 catches the punt on the b25 and runs to the b35 where he fumbles. during b1’s run, a3 pulls and twists b2’s facemask at the b37. a2 recovers the fumble at the b34 and runs to the b33 where he fumbles, and b2 recovers and is downed at the b30. ruling: b’s ball, first-and-10 on 50. facemask. because this is a foul on a run before a change of possession, team b has the option to enforce the foul from the spot of its fumble; see 14-4-3. because team b has possession at the end of the down and there are no other fouls, the foul can also be enforced from the dead-ball spot; see 14-2-4. a.r. 14.68 personal foul by either team prior to double change of possession third-and-10 on a40. a1 runs to the b24 where he fumbles. b1 recovers at the b20, runs to the b40 and fumbles. a2 recovers at the b40. during a1’s run, at the b22: (a) b2 pulls a2 by the mask; or (b) a3 clips b3. rulings: (a) a’s ball, first-and-10 on b12. facemask. this is a foul on a run before a change of possession, so the foul can be enforced from the spot of a1’s fumble. because team a has possession at the end of the down and there are no other fouls, it would also have the option to enforce the foul from the dead-ball spot; see 14-2-4. (b) b’s ball, first-and-10 on b35. clipping. enforce from the spot of b’s recovery. a.r. 14.69 punt—team b personal foul prior to double change of possession fourth-and-10 on a40. b1 catches the punt on the b25 and runs to the b35 where he fumbles. either at the snap, or during the punt, b3 pulls a3 down by the facemask. a2 recovers the fumble at the b30. ruling: a’s ball, first-and-10 on b15. facemask. because team a has possession at the end of the down and there are no other fouls, the foul can be enforced from the dead-ball spot; see 14-2-4. a.r. 14.70 punt—team a personal foul prior to double change of possession fourth-and-10 on a40. b1 catches the punt on the b25 and runs to the b35 where he fumbles. a2 recovers the fumble and is downed at the b30. either at the snap, or during the punt, a3 pulls b3 down by the facemask. ruling: fourth-and-25 on a25. facemask. previous spot enforcement. 102 double fouls with a change of possession a.r. 14.71 kickoff—team a foul before change—team b foul after change on the opening kickoff, kicking-team player a3 lines up with his foot on the 35-yard line. receiver b2 catches the ball in the end zone and runs it back to the a35. on the runback, b3 blocks low on the a26. ruling: b’s ball, first-and-10 on 50 or rekick a35. this is a double foul with a change of possession, a3 offside, and b3 illegally blocking below the waist. team b would likely decline the offside foul and have their low block foul enforced from the dead ball spot, since the low block occurred in advance of that spot. a.r. 14.72 kickoff—double foul—kickoff out of bounds—team b low block during kick a’s kickoff from the a35 rolls out of bounds on the b10 after last touching a1. b1 had blocked a2 low at the b15 before the kickoff went out of bounds. ruling: rekick a35. kickoff out of bounds and an illegal low block. since both fouls happened during the kick, the fouls offset and there must be a rekick. a.r. 14.73 kickoff—double foul—team b foul in field of play/end zone after change a1 is offside on the kickoff from the a35. b1 catches the ball in end zone and runs to b15. during the run, b2 clips: (a) on b6; or (b) in b’s end zone. rulings: (a) re-kick a35, or b’s ball, first-and-10 on b3. offside and clipping. (b) re-kick a35. this is a double foul with a change of possession, and since the enforcement of b2’s foul would be a safety, the down is replayed. a.r. 14.74 kickoff out of bounds—dead-ball foul by team b kickoff from the a35, and after the ball goes out of bounds untouched at the b20, b1 knocks down a2 from behind. ruling: rekick a35, or b’s ball, first-and-10 on b10. kickoff out of bounds and personal foul unnecessary roughness. this is a double foul with a change of possession, so a’s foul would be declined, and enforcement of b’s foul would be from the dead ball spot. team b would therefore likely choose to replay the down. a.r. 14.75 punt—team a fouls during punt—team b fouls after scoring fourth-and-5 on a28. a1: (a) holds; or (b) clips prior to a punt. b1 catches the kick at the b30 and runs for a touchdown. b2 clips after b1 scores. rulings: (a) touchdown team b. clean hands score. team a has the option to enforce the clipping foul on the try or the kickoff. team a’s offensive holding is declined. if team a chooses to enforce the penalty on the try, team b has the option to choose from which try spot the penalty will be enforced. (b) touchdown team b. kickoff b35. clean hands score. team a’s major foul will bridge, and the double fouls automatically offset at the succeeding spot; there are no enforcement options for either team. a.r. 14.76 punt—both teams foul prior to the kick—kick is blocked fourth-and-10 on 50. at the snap, a5 grabs and twists b5’s facemask. b1 was offside and gets through to block the punt. the ball is recovered at the a45 by: (a) a2; or (b) b2. rulings: (a) fourth-and-10 on 50. facemask and defense offside. team a’s failure to make a first down on the fourth down play, is a “change of possession” that eliminates 5 vs. 15 enforcement. (b) fourth-and-10 on 50. facemask and defense offside. double foul, and b’s foul is not a post-possession foul. there is no 5 vs. 15 enforcement because of the change of possession when team b recovered the punt. a.r. 14.77 team a foul—change of possession—team b live ball/dead ball foul second-and-10 on a35. a1 is offside. b1 intercepts the pass and runs to the a20. b2 clipped on a30: (a) during the runback; or (b) after b1 was downed (dead-ball foul). rulings: (a) b’s ball, first-and-10 on a45. offense offside and clipping. (14-5-2) (b) b’s ball, first-and-10 on a35. offense offside and unnecessary roughness. a.r. 14.78 team a foul—change of possession—team b foul in field of play/end zone third-and-10 on b40. a1 is offside. b1 intercepts pass on b4 and runs to b30. during the run, b2 held: (a) on b10; or (b) in b’s end zone. rulings: (a) b’s ball, first-and-10 on b5. offense offside before the interception, and offensive holding after the change of possession. there is no option to replay the down on a non-kicking play. (b) third-and-10 on b40. replay. if enforcement of team b’s foul on a double foul with a change of possession results in a safety, the down is replayed. a.r. 14.79 field goal—team a foul at snap—team b foul during kick—change of possession fourth-and-3 on b28. team a attempts a field goal from the b36 that is short. b1 picks up the ball at the b6 and returns it to the b40. while the ball was rolling, b2 clipped at the b8. at the snap, a2 was in an illegal formation. ruling: b’s ball, first-and-10 on b3, or a’s ball, fourth-and-3 on b28. b2’s foul is a post-possession foul with clean hands. since this is a kick play, team b has the option to enforce its foul or replay the down. there is no option for 5 vs. 15 enforcement due to the change of possession. 103 double fouls after a change of possession a.r. 14.80 double foul after a change - fumble first-and-10 on b45. a1’s pass is intercepted by b1, and during the interception return, a2 grabs and twists b1’s facemask at the b25, which causes b1 to fumble the ball at the b30. during the fumble, b2 blocks low at the b35. b1 then recovers the ball at the b40. ruling: b’s ball, first-and-10 on b30. this is a double foul after a change of possession, (the interception), so the fouls offset at the spot where team b’s foul would be enforced if it was the only foul. since b2’s low block occurred during a loose ball, these fouls offset at the spot of the fumble, as that is behind the spot of the foul. had team a recovered the fumble, this would be a double foul with a double change of possession, and the down would be replayed, because team a did not get the ball with clean hands. a.r. 14.81 punt—double foul after change of possession fourth-and-7 on a22. a2 punts the ball to b1 who catches the punt at the b35. b1 is tackled by the facemask at the 50. during the return, b5 clips at the: (a) b40 or (b) a45. rulings: (a) b’s ball, first-and-10 on b40. the fouls offset at the spot where team b’s foul would be enforced if it was the only foul, which is the spot of team b’s foul here, because that is less advantageous to team b than the dead ball spot. (b) b’s ball, first-and 10 on the 50. the fouls offset at the spot where team b’s foul would be enforced if it was the only foul, which is the dead ball spot here, because that is less advantageous to team b than the spot of b5’s foul. note: when team b’s foul is not a post possession foul, the end of the kick is irrelevant for enforcement purposes on a double foul after a change of possession. a.r. 14.82 punt—double foul after change of possession fourth-and-10 on 50. during a1’s punt, b1 commits an illegal block in the back at the b20. b2 catches the punt at the b10 and returns it to the b40, where a1 tackles b2 by the facemask. ruling: b’s ball, first-and-10 at b10. the double/after enforcement spot is the spot where team b’s foul would be enforced if it was the only foul. since b’s foul is a post possession foul, the enforcement spot is either the end of the kick or the spot of b’s foul. the illegal block above the waist and the facemask therefore offset at the end of the kick, as that is the least advantageous spot for team b. a.r. 14.83 punt—kick ends in end zone—double foul after change of possession fourth-and-6 on b38. during a1’s punt, b2 blocks a2 low at the b18. the ball lands at the b8, b3 muffs the ball at the b6, and it rolls into the end zone. b2 recovers the ball and runs to the b31 where a8 tackles him by the facemask. ruling: b’s ball, first-and-10 on b18. since b’s foul on this double/after play is a post possession foul, b’s low block and a’s facemask offset at the end of the kick, or the spot of b’s foul, whichever is least advantageous to team b. since the end of the kick is the end zone and would result in a touchback, the end of the kick is deemed to be the b20. the spot of b’s foul at the b18 is therefore used as the enforcement spot. a.r. 14.84 invalid fair-catch signal—legal/late hit on signaller fourth-and-8 on a40. b1 gives an invalid fair-catch signal at the b15 and catches the ball at the b17: (a) a3 tackles b1 at the b17; or (b) a3 strikes b1 in the head after he makes the catch at b17. rulings: (a) b’s ball, first-and-10 on b10. invalid fair catch signal enforced at the spot of the foul. no foul by a3. (b) b’s ball, first-and-10 on b15. double foul after a change of possession. the invalid fair catch signal and unnecessary roughness offset at the b15, because team b’s foul is a spot foul, so that would be the enforcement spot for b1’s foul, if that was the only foul on the play. a.r. 14.85 punt—live-ball and dead-ball fouls—double foul after change of possession fourth-and-14 on a31. a1’s punt is fielded by b3 at the b15 and returned to the b23. during the punt, b4 holds a5 at the b20. immediately after the ball is dead at the b23, a scuffle ensues, and a7 hits b7 in the facemask. unnecessary roughness is called. ruling: b’s ball, first-and-10 on b15. the live ball offensive holding by b4 is a post-possession foul, so it is treated as happening after the change of possession. it combines with the dead ball unnecessary roughness foul by a7, creating a double foul after a change of possession. the penalties therefore offset at the spot where b4’s foul would be enforced if it was the only foul - the spot of b’s foul or the end of the kick, whichever is least advantageous to team b. a.r. 14.86 punt—team b scores—double foul after change of possession fourth-and-10 on a7. the punt is partially blocked, and b1 recovers on the a22 and runs for a touchdown. prior to the score, b2 holds in a’s end zone. after the score, a3 grabs b1’s facemask and throws him to the ground. ruling: b’s ball, first-and-10 on a1. the live ball offensive holding by b2, combines with the dead ball unnecessary roughness foul by a3, and the penalties offset at the a1. since the spot of b’s foul and the dead ball spot are both in a’s end zone, the enforcement of b2’s foul would be from the goal line, if that was the only foul; the ball is therefore spotted on the 1-yard line. 104 a.r. 14.87 interception—momentum—double foul after change of possession second-and-6 on b14. b1 intercepts the pass on the b2, and momentum carries him into the end zone where he attempts to advance. a1 trips b1 which causes b1 to go to the ground in the end zone. b2 grabs and twists a1’s facemask after b1 is down. ruling: b’s ball, first-and-10 on b2. the tripping and unnecessary roughness offset at the spot where b2’s foul would be enforced if it was the only foul. here, that would be the spot of b’s foul or the dead ball spot, whichever is least advantageous to team b. due to the momentum play, the dead-ball spot is the b2, and since b’s foul was a dead ball foul, its enforcement spot would be the dead-ball spot, the b2. a.r. 14.88 interception—end zone—double foul after change of possession third-and-5 on b22. b1 intercepts a pass in b’s end zone and attempts to run the ball out, but during the run, b2 holds in the end zone where b1 is downed. a3 piles on b1 after the tackle. ruling: b’s ball, first-and-10 on b1. the offensive holding and dead ball unnecessary roughness offset at the spot where team b’s foul would be enforced if it was the only foul. here, since the result of the play is a touchback, the dead ball spot is deemed to be the b20. however, b’s foul is behind that spot, and since b fouls in the end zone and runs with the ball, the enforcement of b’s live ball foul in the end zone would be a safety. the fouls therefore offset at the b1. a.r. 14.89 interception—end zone—double foul after change of possession second-and-10 on b30. b1 intercepts the ball in the end zone, runs, and is tackled in the end zone. during the run, b2 clips at the b7, and a2 tackles b1 by the facemask. ruling: b’s ball, first-and-10 on b7. since the result of the play was a touchback, the dead ball spot is deemed to be the b20, (or b25 if on a free kick). the spot of b’s foul was behind that spot, so the fouls offset at the spot of b’s foul. a.r. 14.90 interception—end zone—double foul with/after change third-and-five on b15. b1 intercepts a1's pass in the end zone, tries to run it out, but is tackled in the end zone. during b1's run: (a) b2 pulled a7 down by the facemask at the b3, and a8 grabbed and twisted b1’s facemask in the end zone. back a4 was illegally in motion at the snap; (b) b6 blocked a6 low at the b4. team a had six players on the line of scrimmage at the snap; (c) b5 clipped a5 at the b4, and b5 was upset with the call, so he threw the field judge’s flag into the air. rulings: (a) b’s ball, first-and-10 on b3. the double foul after the change takes precedence over the double foul with a change. the facemask fouls by both teams offset at the spot where b’s foul would be enforced if it was the only foul. since the result of the play is a touchback, the dead ball spot is deemed to be the b20, so the fouls offset at the spot of b’s foul, as that is behind the dead ball spot. the foul for illegal motion is declined by rule. (b) b’s ball, first-and-10 on b2. illegal formation by team a, followed by a low block by b6 after the interception, results in a double foul with a change. since b’s foul occurred inside the b20, it is enforced from the spot of the foul. there is no option to replay the down, because this is not a kick play. (c) b’s ball, first-and-11 on b1. both the clipping and unsportsmanlike conduct are enforced, since a foul against an official is considered a foul between downs. the clip is enforced from the b4 to the b2, the chains are set, and then the unsportsmanlike conduct foul is enforced from the b2 to the b1. (throwing the flag in the air is not a disqualifying foul.) a.r. 14.91 double foul with / after change of possession—team b’s impetus fourth-and-10 on a43. the punt is rolling on the ground at the b4 when b1 bats the loose ball backward into his end zone, thinking he can create a touchback. (a) in the scramble for the ball in the end zone, a7 and b2 grab and twist each other’s facemasks, after which b3 downs the ball in the end zone; (b) b2 picks up the ball and is running with it in the end zone, when a7 and b2 grab and twist each other’s facemasks. b2 is then tackled in the end zone; or (c) in the scramble for the ball in the end zone, b2 grabs and twists a7’s facemask, after which b2 recovers and downs the ball in the end zone. a3 then piles on. rulings: (a) fourth-and-10 on a43. replay the down. this is a double foul with a change of possession, because a7’s foul is before the change, and b2’s foul is post possession, thus treated as after the change. since team b’s impetus put the ball in the end zone, and b then fouled there, the enforcement of b2’s foul would create a safety; therefore, by rule, the down is replayed. (b) b’s ball, first-and-10 on b1. this is a double foul after a change of possession. team b’s impetus, (bat), put the ball in the end zone, after which both teams fouled in the end zone. team b’s foul would be enforced from the end zone resulting in a safety, if it was the only foul. the fouls therefore offset at the b1. (c) safety, safety kick b20. this is a clean hands score. the bat is legal, but it creates new impetus, resulting in a safety when b downs the ball in its end zone. team a has clean hands at the time of the score, so the score counts, and a7’s personal foul is enforced on the safety kick. b2’s personal foul on the scoring play also bridges to the safety kick, where both fouls offset. a.r. 14.92 double after change of possession—team b’s impetus third-and-2 on b8. a1 runs to the b5 and fumbles. b1 bats the loose ball backward into his end zone. b2 picks up the ball there and runs to the b17 where he is tackled by the facemask. during b2’s run, b3 blocks low at the b10. ruling: b’s ball, first-and-10 on b10. this is a double foul after a change of possession. the low block and facemask fouls offset at the spot of b’s foul, as that is behind the dead ball spot. the bat by b1 is legal. 105 a.r. 14.93 interception—double with/double after fouls first-and-10 on 50. illegal motion by a1, and the pass is intercepted by b1 at the b20. on the return, b2 commits an illegal block in the back at the b30, and a2 tackles b1 by the facemask at the b40. ruling: b’s ball, first-and-10 on b30. illegal motion prior to the interception, followed by an illegal block in the back and a personal foul facemask. the double foul after a change takes precedence over the double foul with a change, and the fouls offset at the spot of b’s foul, as that is behind the dead ball spot and would be the enforcement spot if the only foul was b’s foul. a’s illegal motion foul is declined by rule. a.r. 14.94 kickoff—double with / double after—option to replay team a is offside on the kickoff from the a35. team b catches the ball at the b15, and during the return, b2 clips at the b45 and is tackled at the b37. a1 piles on. ruling: b’s ball, first-and-10 on b37, or team b has the option to replay the down. the double foul after a change takes precedence over the double foul with a change, so the fouls offset at the spot where team b’s foul would be enforced if it was the only foul. on this play, that is the dead ball spot, which is behind the spot of b’s foul. since this is a kicking play, and there is also a double foul with a change, team b also has the option to require a rekick from the a35. a.r. 14.95 kickoff out of bounds—dead-ball fouls by both teams kickoff from the a35 goes out of bounds at the b24, after which a1 and b2 commit dead-ball fouls. ruling: b’s ball, first-and-10 on b24, or team b has the option to replay the down. this is a double foul with a change and a double foul after a change. the double after takes precedence and is enforced from the spot where b’s foul would be enforced if it was the only foul. here, that is the dead-ball spot, which is also the spot of the foul. since there is also a foul by team a before the change of possession creating a double foul with a change on a kicking play, team b also has the option to require a rekick from the a35. there is not an option to offset the dead ball fouls at the b40. a.r. 14.96 double foul with/after change of possession—end zone involvement third-and-five on b15. b1 intercepts a1's pass in the end zone, tries to run it out, but is tackled in the end zone. a4 was illegally in motion at the snap. during b1's run, (a) b6 blocked a6 low at the b4; or (b) b2 pulled a7 down by the facemask at the b3, and a8 grabbed and twisted b1’s facemask in the end zone. rulings: (a) b’s ball, first-and-10 on b2. double foul with a change. by rule, the illegal formation prior to the change is declined, and b’s low block is enforced from the spot of the foul, since it occurred inside the b20 (which is deemed to be the dead ball spot). (b) b’s ball, first-and-10 on b3. the double foul after a change takes precedence over the double foul with a change, so a’s illegal motion penalty is declined by rule. since the result of the play is a touchback, the dead ball spot is deemed to be the b20. the facemask penalties offset at the spot where b’s foul would be enforced if it was the only foul. here, that is the spot of b’s foul, since that spot is behind the dead ball spot. double foul with double change of possession a.r. 14.97 kickoff—double foul—double change on a kickoff from the a35, a1 illegally touches the ball on the a43. b1 picks up the ball at a44, runs to the a25, fumbles, and a2 recovers the ball there. during b1’s run, b2 clipped at the a35. ruling: rekick a35. illegal touch of a kick and clipping. this is a double foul with a double change of possession, and the last team in possession was not clean prior to recovering the ball. therefore, the down must be replayed. a.r. 14.98 double foul—double change first-and-10 on 50. illegal motion by a1 and offside by b1. b2 intercepts, and during the return, b5 clips. b2 then fumbles the ball back to a2. ruling: a’s ball, first-and-10 on 50. illegal motion and defense offside prior to the interception, and clipping by b5 during the return. the double foul before the change of possession requires a replay, because the team last in possession did not get it with clean hands. a.r. 14.99 double foul—double change first-and-10 on 50. illegal motion by a1, and b1 then intercepts the pass. on b’s runback, b2 clips. b1 then fumbles and a2 recovers. ruling: a’s ball, first-and-10 on 50. replay. illegal motion by team a followed by clipping by team b. if there are fouls by both teams and multiple changes of possession during a down, if the team last in possession did not get the ball prior to fouling, the down is replayed. a.r. 14.100 double foul/double change—dead-ball foul by team last in possession third-and-10 on b40. b1 intercepts a pass on the b10 and runs to the b20 where he fumbles. during the run, b2 holds on the b15. a1 recovers the fumble at the b22 and goes out of bounds at the b12 after which a2 roughs b2. ruling: a’s ball, first-and-10 on b27. the last team in possession, (team a), was foul-free when they got the ball, so they will keep the ball after enforcement. team b’s foul was before the last change, and team a’s foul was after the last change, so the double foul with a change of possession will be enforced – a’s dead ball unnecessary roughness penalty is enforced from the dead ball spot. 106 a.r. 14.101 double foul/double change—player disqualified second-and-10 on b40. b1 intercepts the pass on the b10 and runs to the b20. during b1’s run, b2 punches a1 at the 50, and a2 tackles b2 by the mask, causing b2 to fumble and a1 recovers at the b25. ruling: a’s ball, second-and-10 on b40. since the last team in possession (team a), was not foul-free when it recovered the ball, the unnecessary roughness and facemask offset and the down is replayed. disqualify b2. a.r. 14.102 double foul/double change first-and-10 on 50. b1 intercepts on the b20. b1 fumbles, and a1 recovers and runs with the ball. a2 holds during the run. a1 fumbles, and b2 recovers and is tackled at the a40. during b2’s run, b3 blocks low at the 50. ruling: b’s ball, first-and-10 on b35. team b got possession with clean hands, so it retains possession after enforcement of the double foul with a change of possession. team a’s offensive hold is declined by rule, and team b’s block below the waist penalty is enforced from the spot of the foul. fouls after change of possession a.r. 14.103 team a’s impetus and team a’s foul first-and-10 on 50. b1 intercepts a pass in his own end zone where he is tackled. during b1’s run in the end zone, (a) a2 blocks b2 below the waist; or (b) a2 trips b2, in the field of play or in the end zone. rulings: (a) b’s ball, first-and-10 on b35. (b) b’s ball, first-and-10 on b30. when the result of the play is a touchback, the enforcement spot for all fouls by team a, (personal fouls or otherwise), is the 20-yard line or the 25 for a free kick. a.r. 14.104 team b’s impetus—team a foul first-and-10 on 50. b1 intercepts on the b8, scrambles, and carries the ball into his own end zone where he is tackled (not momentum exception). during the run, a2 blocks low anywhere. ruling: b’s ball, first-and-10 on b15. since the result of the play would be a safety, because team b’s impetus put the ball in their own end zone, a2’s foul is enforced from the goal line. (14-4-4) a.r. 14.105 interception—team b runs and fouls in end zone first-and-10 on 50. b1 intercepts in the end zone and runs with the ball. b2 clips in the end zone during the run. b1 is downed in the end zone or field of play. ruling: safety. safety kick b20. since team a’s impetus put the ball in the end zone, the result of the play is not a safety. the foul that occurred in the end zone during b1’s run is used to create the safety, so no yardage is enforced on the safety kick. a.r. 14.106 interception—team b runs and fouls in field of play first-and-10 on 50. b1 intercepts in the end zone and runs with the ball. b2 clips in the field of play at the b16 during the run. b1 is downed in the end zone. ruling: b’s ball, first-and-10 on b8. the clipping foul is enforced from the spot of the foul, since that spot is behind the b20 (touchback spot). a.r. 14.107 interception—no attempt to advance—dead ball foul first-and-10 on 50. b1 intercepts at the b16 and is downed immediately with no return. b2 clips in the end zone or field of play after b1 was downed. ruling: b’s ball, first-and-10 on b8. the dead-ball unnecessary roughness is enforced from the succeeding spot. a.r. 14.108 interception in end zone and advance—team b foul in field of play first-and-10 on 50. b1 intercepts in the end zone and runs with the ball. b2 clips in the field of play at the b16 during the run. b1 is downed in the field of play at the b25. ruling: b’s ball, first-and-10 on b8. the clipping foul is enforced from the spot of the foul, since that spot is behind the dead ball spot. a.r. 14.109 punt ends in end zone—team b fouls during punt—tackled in end zone fourth-and-10 on 50. b1 catches the punt in the end zone, runs with the ball, but is tackled in the end zone. b2 clips at the b16 while the punt is in the air. ruling: b’s ball, first-and-10 on b8. the end of the kick is the b20 (touchback), so enforcement is from the spot of the foul (b16). a.r. 14.110 illegal substitution by team b during scrimmage kick fourth-and-5 on a45. b1 touches a1’s punt at the b5. the ball then rolls into the end zone where b1 picks it up and runs, although he is tackled in the end zone. team b substitutes thought the play was over when the ball rolled into the end zone. team b players started onto the field at the b35 before b1 was tackled in the end zone. ruling: b’s ball, first-and-10 on b15. since the punt ended in the end zone, and team a’s impetus put the ball there, b’s illegal substitution at the b35 is enforced from the b20. a.r. 14.111 punt out of bounds—team b foul in end zone fourth-and-10 on 50. a1’s punt rolls out of bounds at the b16, and b2 clips in the end zone during the punt. ruling: b’s ball, first-and-10 on b8. the clipping foul is enforced from the end of the kick. the foul in the end zone is treated as though it occurred at the b20. 107 a.r. 14.112 punt out of bounds—team b foul in field of play fourth-and-10 on 50. b2 clips at the b10 while the punt is in the air. the ball rolls out of bounds at the b16. ruling: b’s ball, first-and-10 on b5. the clipping foul is enforced from the spot of the foul, since it was behind the end of the kick. a.r. 14.113 punt—first touch—team b foul in end zone fourth-and-5 on a40. a1 first touches the punt on b10. b1 picks up ball at the b7 and runs to b20. b2 held a2 in team b end zone during the run by b1. ruling: safety. safety kick b20. since the holding penalty occurred in the end zone, and b ran with the ball, the enforcement results in a safety. the enforcement of the penalty eliminates the first touch. a.r. 14.114 missed field goal—team b foul during kick fourth-and-8 on b22. a field goal attempt from the b30 is blocked at the b28, and the ball bounces to the b12 where it rolls out of bounds. before the ball went out of bounds, b3 clipped a2 at the b15. ruling: b’s ball, first-and-10 on b6. the clipping foul is clearly not committed in an attempt to block the kick, so it is a post-possession foul enforced from the end of the kick. a.r. 14.115 missed field goal—team b foul during kick fourth-and-8 on b22. a field goal attempt from the b30 is blocked at the b28, and the ball rolls out of bounds in b’s end zone. before the ball went out of bounds, b3 clipped a2 at the b16. ruling: b’s ball, first-and-10 on b8. the clipping foul is a post possession foul enforced from the spot of the foul. on a field-goal attempt, if team b touches the kick anywhere beyond the line of scrimmage, if a team b foul on the play is accepted, or if the kick is recovered by either team behind the line of scrimmage, team b loses the option to go back to the spot of the kick (or the 20-yard line). scoring plays a.r. 14.116 touchdown—dead-ball foul first-and-10 on 50. runner a1 crosses b’s goal line after which: (a) a2 commits a personal foul; or (b) b1 commits a personal foul. rulings: (a) touchdown team a. team b has the option to enforce the personal foul on the try or the kickoff.

(b) a’s ball, first-and-25 on a35. if the dead ball foul occurs between downs or is a foul against an official, it is enforced after the chains are set, so it is first-and-25 after enforcement. a.r. 14.132 failure to make line to gain on fourth down—team b dead ball foul fourth-and-10 on 50. quarterback a1 scrambles and is run out of bounds by b1 at the a40, after which b1 immediately taunts a1. ruling: b’s ball, first-and-10 on b45. the dead-ball foul is enforced from the succeeding spot. the unsportsmanlike conduct foul counts toward a potential disqualification for two such fouls. a.r. 14.133 team a fouls in its end zone and then commits dead-ball foul third-and-10 on a4. a2 held in his end zone prior to an incomplete pass. a3 roughed b1 after the incompletion. ruling: safety. safety kick a20 or a’s ball fourth-and-12 on a2. multiple fouls by a, and only one can be enforced. a.r. 14.134 safety—dead-ball foul by team b fourth-and-10 on a10. a1 is sacked in his own end zone, after which b1 piles on. ruling: safety. safety kick a35. a.r. 14.135 safety—live-ball foul by team a and dead-ball foul by team b third-and-10 on a10. a2 is illegally in motion at the snap, and a1 is sacked in his own end zone. after the ball is dead, b1 piles on. ruling: safety. safety kick on a35. team b scored with clean hands, so the team a foul is declined, and the team b foul is enforced on the safety kick. a.r. 14.136 safety—dead-ball foul by team b fourth-and-15 on a2. punter a1 jumps to catch the high snap and comes down on the end line. he punts and is then roughed by b1. ruling: safety. safety kick a35. this is a dead ball foul for unnecessary roughness (late hit), not roughing the kicker, as the ball is dead when a1 touches the end line. a.r. 14.137 fourth down—fumble forward out of bounds—team b dead-ball foul fourth-and-1 on b30. a1 runs to the b30 and fumbles the ball forward out of bounds at the b28. b1 commits a personal foul immediately after the ball goes out of bounds. ruling: b’s ball, first-and-10 on b15. the personal foul is after the ball is out of bounds, so team b takes over at the dead ball spot (spot of the fumble), and the dead-ball foul is enforced from there. a.r. 14.138 two-point try—team b dead ball foul on a two-point try, a1 runs with the ball to the b1 and fumbles there. the ball rolls into the end zone where a2 recovers, and b2 piles on. ruling: try fails. kickoff 50. two-minute fumble rules are in effect on a try, so the unnecessary roughness is after the try ends and is enforced on the kickoff. a.r. 14.139 successful field goal—team b live ball foul—team a dead ball foul fourth-and-goal on b5. on a field-goal attempt from the b13, b1 is called for (a) leaping; or (b) holding immediately after the snap. the field goal is good. after the score, a2 then punches b1. rulings: (a) field goal is good. kickoff a35. this is a clean hands score, so both the leaping and unnecessary roughness fouls carry over and offset on the kickoff. there is no option for team a. disqualify a2. (b) field goal is good. ko a20. “clean hands score.” only the dead-ball unnecessary roughness carries over to the kickoff. disqualify a2. a.r. 14.140 team b dead-ball foul behind the line third-and-10 on a35. a1 scrambles behind the line and is finally tackled at the a10. b2 piles on after a1 is down. ruling: first-and-10 on a25. this dead-ball unnecessary roughness is enforced from the succeeding spot (a10). note: if this had occurred on fourth down, it would have been b’s ball, first-and-10 on a25. the dead-ball foul is enforced after the change of possession. 110 a.r. 14.141 last play of half—fumble—team b dead-ball foul fourth-and-4 on b18. the score is tied on the last play of the half. a’s field-goal attempt is blocked and the ball rolls to the b28. kicker a2 picks up the ball, runs to the b19, and throws a pass to eligible a6 at the b15. a6 catches the pass at the b15, runs to the b5, fumbles, and: (a) a8 recovers at the b2 and scores; or (b) a6 recovers his fumble at the b4 and b8 piles on him after he is tackled. rulings: (a) half over. no score. a8 was not the fumbling player. (b) half over. enforce b’s foul for unnecessary roughness on the opening kickoff of the second half (or overtime). a.r. 14.142 failed try two-point try—personal foul in continuing action a1 scores on the last play of the fourth quarter to make the score 34-32 in favor of team b. on the ensuing try from the b2, a2 is driven out of bounds at the b½-yard line, and b2 hits him late out of bounds. ruling: game over. team b wins 34-32. there is no extension or enforcement of the dead ball unnecessary roughness, as it would be enforced on the kickoff. there would be no replay of the try attempt, even if time remained on the clock. a.r. 14.143 run ends in field of play—multiple team a fouls against official third-and-10 on b40. a1 runs to the b35 where he is tackled inbounds. immediately after a1 is down, a3 screams in the face of the down judge that a1 was tackled by the facemask, and then a2 shoves the official. ruling: fourth-and-35 on a35. disqualify a2. both unsportsmanlike conduct fouls are enforced in this situation, as a foul against an official is always enforced as a foul between downs. the foul by a3 counts toward a disqualification, if he commits another foul of this type. a.r. 14.144 multiple fouls—by team b—live ball/foul against official third-and-10 on b40. b1 commits pass interference at the b28. right after the play, b1 is angry about the foul and throws his helmet down at the ground in the direction of the official. ruling: first-and-10 on b14. disqualify b1. the foul against the official is treated as a foul between downs, so both the defensive pass interference and unsportsmanlike conduct are enforced. a.r. 14.145 double foul—team a live ball foul—team b dead ball foul second-and-10 on b40. a1 drops back to pass. a2 holds b1 while pass blocking. a1 passes complete to a3 at the b30 and he is tackled either inbounds or out of bounds, after which b2 piles on. ruling: second-and-10 on b40. replay the down. the offensive holding and dead ball personal foul offset. note: live ball fouls combine with dead-ball fouls to create double fouls. a.r. 14.146 double foul—team b live ball foul—dead ball fouls by both teams first-and-ten on a20. back a2 takes a handoff and runs to the b20 where he is tackled. during a2's run, b6 pulls a6’s facemask at the b10. after the play, a2 shoves b4 and b4 shoves a2 (both actions are unnecessary roughness). ruling: a’s ball, first-and-10 on a20. replay the down. the live ball facemask combines with the dead ball personal foul to create a double foul. there is no option to decline the live ball facemask and offset the dead ball unnecessary roughness fouls at the dead ball spot. a.r. 14.147 multiple fouls by team a—live ball/dead ball—runner makes first down first-and-10 on 50. a3 is illegally downfield on a forward pass. the pass is complete to a2, who is tackled inbounds at the b30. immediately after a1 is tackled, a1 taunts b3. ruling: a’s ball, first-and-15 on a45. multiple fouls. the ineligible downfield would be accepted. if the taunting was accepted, it would be enforced from the succeeding spot and the down would count, a’s ball, first-and-10 on b45. even though the unsportsmanlike conduct foul is declined, it still counts toward a potential disqualification for two such fouls. a.r. 14.148 multiple fouls by team a—live ball/dead ball first-and-10 on 50. incomplete pass by a1, and offensive pass interference on the play at the b25. after the pass is incomplete, a2 roughs b2. ruling: a’s ball, second-and-25 on a35. multiple fouls. the unnecessary roughness would be accepted, as the down would count, and the offensive pass interference would be declined. a.r. 14.149 multiple fouls by team b—live ball/dead ball first-and-10 on 50. incomplete pass by a1, and b1 commits defensive pass interference on the play at the b25. after the pass is incomplete, b2 roughs the passer. ruling: a’s ball, first-and-10 on b25. multiple fouls. the defensive pass interference would be accepted and the roughing-the-passer penalty would be declined, as it would be enforced from the previous spot. a.r. 14.150 multiple fouls by team b—live ball/dead ball—fourth down fourth-and-15 on b40. a2 runs a draw up the middle to the b36. during the run, nose tackle b1 holds a2 at the b38 to prevent him from blocking linebacker b2. b3 piles on after the play. ruling: a’s ball, first-and-10 on b31. multiple fouls. since team a did not make the line to gain, it must accept the live-ball defensive hold and decline the dead-ball unnecessary roughness, or it would be b’s ball. 111 a.r. 14.151 live ball and foul between downs by same team first-and-10 on 50. a3 is illegally downfield. the pass is completed to a2 who either runs out of bounds or is tackled inbounds at the b30. as the referee begins his announcement for the ineligible receiver downfield, a2 taunts b1. ruling: a’s ball, first-and-30 on a30. the ineligible receiver downfield is enforced, and the significant delay after the play ends and before the dead-ball taunting, permits both fouls to be enforced. the unsportsmanlike conduct foul counts toward a potential disqualification for two such fouls. a.r. 14.152 multiple fouls by team a—live ball/dead ball—touchdown third-and-5 on b10. as quarterback a1 drops back to pass, a2 holds b1 at the line of scrimmage. a1 subsequently completes a pass to a3 in the end zone for a touchdown. running back a4, in his excitement, runs into the end zone to congratulate a3 and takes off his helmet in the process. the field judge throws a flag for uns. ruling: third-and-15 on b20. team b must accept the offensive holding and decline the unsportsmanlike conduct to negate the touchdown. miscellaneous plays a.r. 14.153 foul between halves or before overtime at the end of the first half, or at the end of regulation time of a game going into overtime, one of the coaches or players argues with, and shoves, an official. ruling: unsportsmanlike conduct fouls between halves, or between the end of the regulation game and overtime, are assessed on the kickoff at the start of the second half or overtime. disqualify the coach or player involved, if appropriate. a.r. 14.154 failure to make line to gain on third down—team a player punches opponent third-and-10 on a10. a1 is downed on a16. during the run, a2 punches b1 at the a12. ruling: fourth-and-4 on a16, or third-and-14 on a6. disqualify a2. a2 is disqualified regardless of whether the unnecessary roughness penalty is accepted or declined. a.r. 14.155 touchdown—enforcement of major fouls by both teams third-and-10 on a30. while a1 is running with the ball at the b25, b1 grabs and pulls his facemask. a1 scores on the play. (a) after a1 crosses the goal line, a1 shoves b1, knocking him to the ground; (b) well after a1 has crossed the goal line, and as a1 is running toward his bench, a1 shoves b1, knocking him to the ground; (c) after team a has elected to enforce b1’s facemask on the kickoff, but before the ready for play for the try, a1 shoves b1, knocking him to the ground; or (d) after team a has elected to enforce b1’s facemask on the kickoff, and after the ready for play for the try, a1 shoves b1, knocking him to the ground rulings: (a) these fouls happened on the play and in the continuing action after the play, so they offset on the kickoff, and neither team has the option to enforce on the try. (this is a clean-hands score.) (b) the first foul happened on the play, and the second foul happened clearly between downs, so each team will have the option to enforce the other team’s foul on either the kickoff or try. that election will be made in the order of occurrence. (c) b1’s foul will be enforced on the kickoff, as once that election has been made, the team cannot change their decision. team b will then have the option to enforce a1’s foul on the try or the kickoff. (d) b1’s foul will be enforced on the kickoff, as once that election has been made, the team cannot change their decision. a1’s foul will be enforced on the try, since that foul happened after the ready for play. note: if team a fouls after the ready for play on a try, that foul can only be enforced on the try. if team b fouls after the ready for play on a try, team a has the option to enforce that foul on the try or the kickoff. rule 16 overtime procedures a.r. 16.1 opening kickoff return for touchdown team b receives the opening kickoff and returns it for a touchdown in the (a) regular season; or (b) postseason. rulings: (a) game over. team b wins. no try.

own five-yard line. on its first play from scrimmage, qba1 throws a pass that is tipped at the line of scrimmage and intercepted by b7 in a’s end zone. ruling: game over, team b wins 19-10. the play is allowed to continue to its conclusion, and a score by either team counts. both teams have had their opportunity for possession, so the game is over at the conclusion of the play. a.r. 16.32 team a trails—interception in or advances into a’s end zone trailing 13-10 after the first team to possess the ball in overtime kicks a successful field goal, the second team receives the kickoff and is downed at its own 15-yard line. on its first play from scrimmage, qba1 throws a pass that is intercepted at the a20 by b1, who continues to run with the ball across team a’s goal line. ruling: b wins 19-10. whether the pass is intercepted in team a's end zone or the field of play and advanced into the end zone, the play is allowed to continue until its conclusion, and a score by either team counts. a.r. 16.33 regular season—team a trails when period expires during a regular season game, the first team scores a field goal on its initial possession of overtime. the second team receives the kickoff and is downed at its own 10-yard line. time expires during the second team’s possession. ruling: game over, the first team wins. for preseason and regular season games, there is a maximum of one 10-minute period. the game is over at the end of that period, and the result is based on the score at that point. a.r. 16.34 post season—team a trails when period expires during a post-season game, the first team scores a field goal on its initial possession of overtime. the second team receives the kickoff and is downed at its own 10-yard line. time expires during the second team’s possession. 115 ruling: a second overtime period will begin, and the game will continue until the second team’s possession ends. if it does not score, the game is over, and the first team wins. if it scores a field goal, the game will continue, and the next team to score by any means shall be declared the winner. 2022 instant replay casebook of the national football league devised, amended, and

and momentum/touchback. formations are not reviewable. once the kick is possessed, it becomes a running play, and those guidelines apply. when on-field officials award possession to the kicking team at the end of any free kick down, including when that ruling is negated by a foul, it is an automatic replay official review. illegal touching a.r. 15.1 illegal touch after being out of bounds on a kickoff from the a35, the ball is rolling loose at the sideline at the b40. a1 goes out of bounds, re-establishes, and is the first to touch at the b40 where he recovers the ball. there are no flags

contact with the kicker), whether the ball hit the ground, a boundary line, the pylon, or anything on a boundary line. touching of a kick is reviewable, but replay cannot review whether a player was responsible for touching the ball (see 9-2). the recovery of a scrimmage kick is also reviewable (see loose balls). this includes whether a punt was possessed and fumbled, or muffed. replay can also review whether a kick from scrimmage hit a scoreboard, guide wire, flag, or any other object. if it is not detected by the officials on the field, the replay official can stop the game to review at any time including outside two minutes of either half. a team could also challenge this if it occurs before the two-minute warning. if it is determined that the ball hit an object, then the down will be replayed from the previous spot and the game clock will be reset to when the ball was snapped and then started on the next snap. this applies to all loose balls. for field goal and try attempts,

gain or the goal line. this is reviewable in the field of play and at the sideline. following a line to gain review, the ball will be placed at the correct dead-ball spot, but the challenge will be successful only if the line to gain ruling is changed. the next situation involves a player allowed to advance by the officials because he is ruled not down by contact or not out of bounds. replay can review whether the player should have been down by contact or out of bounds before the advance. if the officials put the player down or out of bounds, replay can only review the position of the ball in relation to the line to gain or the goal line, and can award a td or fumble (with clear recovery) that occurs before the runner takes two additional steps after he had been ruled to touch out of bounds. if a player was falling or being tackled and officials erroneously rule the player down by contact at the start of the fall or tackle, replay can place the ball at the correct down-by-contact spot, provided the player did not regain his balance and continue to run. if on-field officials rule forward progress, then replay can only review the position of the ball in relation to the line to gain or goal line and can rule that there is a fumble (with clear recovery) if possession is lost prior to or simultaneously with the defensive contact. if the line to gain or goal line is not involved, the spot of forward progress is not reviewable. replay cannot review whether a runner’s forward progress should have been ruled as stopped or whether a runner gave himself up. if a runner’s helmet comes off during the play, this is treated the same as down by contact. replay can review the position of the ball in relation to the line to gain or the goal line when the runner’s helmet came completely off his head. line to gain a.r. 15.42 line to gain in field of play third-and-10 on a20. a2 takes a handoff and runs close to the first down marker. officials spot the ball at the 29 even

near the sideline and is pushed out of bounds at the a40. officials rule that the ball crossed the sideline at the a39 and make it fourth down. replays show that the ball crossed the sideline at the a41. ruling: reviewable. a’s ball first-and-10 on a41. a.r. 15.44 line to gain at the sideline, player ruled out of bounds third-and-5 on a35. a1 runs near the sideline and officials rule that he stepped out of bounds at the a39 and spot the ball there. replays show that a1 did not step out of bounds at the a39, and when his foot was near the sideline, the ball was at the a40. ruling: reviewable. a’s ball first-and-10 on a40. whether a1 stepped out of bounds at the a39 is not reviewable. however, the spot of the ball when a1 was ruled out of bounds is reviewable in relation to the line to gain. a.r. 15.45 forward progress related to line to gain third-and-10 on b20. a1 runs to the b9-yard line and then gets driven back by defenders. officials rule forward progress was stopped at the 11-yard line. 8 ruling: reviewable. a’s ball first-and-goal on b9. when on-field officials rule that a runner’s forward progress was stopped, the ball is spotted at its furthest point before the runner was driven backward. a.r. 15.46 re-spotting of ball third-and-3 on a40. a2 takes a handoff and is tackled near the line to gain. the officials spot the ball at the a41. team a challenges that the ball reached the line to gain. replays show the correct spot was at the a42. ruling: reviewable play. a’s ball, fourth-and-1 on a42. the ball is re-spotted at the a42, but since the line to gain was not reached team a loses the challenge and is charged a timeout. a.r. 15.47 forward progress near sideline second-and-3 on b43. qba1 throws a forward pass to a2 at the b40 where he is contacted by b3. a2 runs forward to the b39 and is then driven backwards and out of bounds at the b41. officials rule a2 out of bounds, stop the clock and mark the ball short of the line to gain at the b41. team a wants to challenge that the forward progress of a2 was stopped beyond the line to gain. ruling: not reviewable. a’s ball third-and-1 on b41. an on-field ruling regarding whether the runner’s forward progress was stopped in the field of play is not reviewable. however, if officials rule that forward progress was stopped in the field of play, the spot of forward progress in relation to the line to gain or the goal line is reviewable. down by contact a.r. 15.48 runner down by contact first-and-10 on a30. a2 takes a handoff and runs to the a40-yard line where he is hit by a defender and his right knee hits the ground, but he continues to run and is eventually tackled at the b43-yard line. officials rule the runner down at the b43. ruling: reviewable. a’s ball

but it cannot challenge the spot of the ball when officials ruled the ball short of the line to gain. if team a challenged the line to gain ruling, the ball would be placed at the b42, and the challenge would be unsuccessful. fumbles (loose balls) there are several situations involving fumbles that are reviewable. the most frequent is whether a runner fumbled or was down by contact. if the ruling on the field is a fumble, then replay can determine whether the runner was down by contact, out of bounds, or that his helmet came completely off before he lost possession. replay cannot rule on whether a runner’s forward progress was stopped before the fumble. if a runner is ruled down or out of bounds, but he really fumbled the ball, there must be a clear recovery in the continuing action after the fumble to give the ball to the recovering team. if on-field officials make a preliminary ruling of which team recovered the ball, that preliminary ruling constitutes a clear recovery. if there is no clear recovery, but the ball clearly is recovered in the end zone of the team that fumbled the ball, it is a safety. replay can also review whether a loose ball touched a boundary line, or anything on a boundary line, including the pylon. if there is no video evidence as to which player recovered the loose ball, the ruling on the field stands. fumbles a.r. 15.57 runner down before

out of a pile with the ball is not a clear recovery. if the players piled on the ball are all from the same team, then it is a clear recovery. a.r. 15.63 fumble following interception, no clear

requirements have been met, he must perform an act common to the game or maintain control of the ball long enough to do so. if the player does not complete all three of the requirements, the pass is incomplete. these guidelines apply both on the field and in replay. passes in field of play a.r. 15.93 process complete third-and-5 on a30. pass over the middle to the b45 is ruled incomplete. replay

15.104 heel/toe third-and-10 on a30. a2 controls a pass and gets his left foot down in bounds at the 50. as his right foot comes down, the heel hits in bounds and in the normal motion of taking a step, his toes hit out of bounds. officials rule complete. ruling: reviewable. a’s ball fourth-and-10 on a30. incomplete. adjust clock if wound before review. if any part of the foot hits out of bounds during the normal process of taking a step (no drag or delay), then the foot is out of bounds. a.r. 15.105 no force-out second-and-10 on 50. pass goes to a2 near the sideline at the b35. a2 controls the ball while airborne, but before he can get both feet down, he is knocked out of bounds by defender b3 where he maintains control of the ball when he lands. official rules complete.

defender. a.r. 15.106 receiver who is out of bounds making catch first-and-10 on a20. wide receiver a1 leaps and catches a legal forward pass at the 50 and runs for a touchdown. replays show a1’s left foot on the sideline right before he jumped. ruling: reviewable. incomplete pass, a’s ball second-and-10 on a20. reset game clock to the time when the receiver touched the ball. only the replay official can initiate a review of this play. a.r. 15.107 pass complete, no advance first-and-10 on a20. qba1 throws a pass to a2 who leaps at the a35-yard line near the sideline, makes the catch and runs for a touchdown. officials rule a2 was out of bounds before making the catch and did not re-establish in bounds, making the pass incomplete. replays show that a2 was never out of bounds. ruling: reviewable. complete pass. a’s ball first-and-10 on a35. on these plays, replay can award a catch, but not the advance, since the original ruling was incomplete. reset the clock to the time when a2 caught the ball, and wind clock on the ready-for-play. a.r. 15.108 receiver loses control, ball hits ground first-and-10 on a20. qba1 throws a pass to a2 at the a35-yard line near the sideline. a2 gains control of the ball and gets both feet down in bounds, but does not perform an act common to the game as he falls to the ground, where he loses the ball when he hits the ground. officials rule complete. ruling: reviewable. incomplete pass. a’s ball second-and-10 on a20. reset the clock to the time when the ball hit the ground. receiver did not complete all elements of the catch before

gains control of the ball and gets two feet down in bounds, but does not perform an act common to the game as he falls to the ground out of bounds. a2 momentarily loses control of the ball when he hits the ground out of bounds. he regains control before the ball touches the ground. officials rule complete. ruling: reviewable. incomplete pass. a’s ball second-and-10 on a20. adjust clock if wound before review. receiver did not complete all elements of the catch, so he must maintain control of the ball through his contact with the ground. if he is touching the sideline, any loss of control during the process of the catch makes the pass incomplete. a.r. 15.110 defender out of bounds first-and-10 on a20. qba1 throws a pass to a2 near the sideline at the a35. a2 and b2 jump up to catch the pass, a2 comes down inbounds, but b2’s left foot hits the sideline before the rest of his body lands in bounds. officials rule an incomplete pass. ruling: reviewable. a’s ball first-and-10 on a35. because a2 completed the process of the catch inbounds and was in control of the ball when b2 touched the sideline, this is a completed pass. non-reviewable situations on passes a.r. 15.111 down by contact first-and-10 on a20. qba1 scrambles to the a17 where he is hit by b3 and stumbles as he releases a pass that falls incomplete at the a30. the referee rules that the a1’s left knee was down before he released the ball. replays show that he was still up when he threw the pass. ruling: not reviewable. a’s ball second-and-13 on a17. when a player is ruled down by contact, replay cannot make it a pass (forward or backward). a.r. 15.112 out of bounds first-and-10 on a20. qba1 scrambles near the sideline to the a17 and throws a pass that is caught by a2 at the a30. the referee rules that the qb’s left foot was out of bounds before he released the ball. replays show that his foot was not out of bounds. ruling: not reviewable. a’s ball second-and-13 on a17. on this type of play, when a player is ruled out of bounds, replay cannot make it a pass (forward or backward). pass complete/fumble or incomplete replay can review whether a pass was complete followed by a fumble, or instead, the receiver did not gain possession of the ball and it should be incomplete. if a player has firm control of the ball with two feet or another body part (other than his hands) touching down inbounds, and then performs an act common to the game before losing it, it is a catch and fumble. if the receiver loses the ball simultaneously or near simultaneously with the second foot coming down (bang-bang), the pass is incomplete. when a pass is ruled incomplete, either team can challenge that it was a catch and fumble and that they gained possession of the ball. if replays show that it was a catch and fumble, the ball will be awarded at the spot of recovery to the team that recovers the ball in the immediate continuing action. if on-field officials make a preliminary ruling of which team recovered the ball, that preliminary ruling constitutes a clear recovery. if there is no clear recovery, the ball will be awarded to the team last in possession at the spot where possession was lost. on fourth down or after the two-minute warning, the ball will be brought back to the spot of the fumble if recovered beyond it by a teammate of the fumbling player. act common to the game a.r. 15.113 receiver performs an act common to the game first-and-10 on a20. qba1 throws a forward pass to a2 at the a35-yard line. a2 catches it and is hit by a defender causing him to lose the ball, and b3 falls on it at the a35. officials rule the pass complete and a fumble. replays show the receiver had control, two feet completely down, and turned up field before he was hit causing him to lose the ball. ruling: reviewable, if the receiver secures control of the ball, touches the ground with two feet or another body part (other than his hands), and then performs an act common to the game before losing control of the ball, it is a catch and fumble in the field of play. b’s ball first-and-10 on a35. only the replay official can initiate a review of this play. a.r. 15.114 receiver performs act common to the game second-and-9 on a18. qba1 throws a pass to a2 at the a31. a2 controls the ball and just as his second foot touches the ground, he is contacted by a defender, and he then takes a third step while being tackled. before the receiver hits the ground, the defender pulls the ball loose. b3 recovers the loose ball at the a35. officials rule incomplete. ruling: reviewable. completed pass and fumble. b’s ball first-and-10 on a35. because the receiver secured control, took two steps, and then took a third step, the process of the catch was complete before the ball came loose. a.r. 15.115 receiver does not perform an act common to the game first-and-10 on a20. qba1 throws a forward pass to a2 at the a28 who takes two steps and immediately gets hit by a defender causing him to lose the ball and b3 falls on it at the a35. officials rule the pass complete and a fumble. replays show that the receiver lost the ball just as his second foot hit the ground. ruling: reviewable, incomplete pass. a’s ball second-and-10 on a20, reset the clock to the time when the ball hit the ground. only the replay official can initiate a review of this play. 16 ball control a.r. 15.116 does not establish control, incomplete first-and-10 on a20. qba1 throws a forward pass to a2 at the a28 who takes two steps and gets hit by a defender. the ball comes out and b3 falls on it. officials rule the pass complete and a fumble and give the ball to b. replays show that a2 did not secure control of the ball before he got hit. ruling: reviewable. incomplete pass, a’s ball second-and-10 on a20. reset the clock to the time when the ball hit the ground, and start on snap. only the replay official can initiate a review of this play. possession after fumble a.r. 15.117 clear recovery second-and-6 on b35. qba1 throws a forward pass to a2 at the b27 who takes three steps and then is hit by a defender, causing him to lose the ball and b3 falls on it at the b25. officials rule the pass incomplete. ruling: reviewable, b’s ball first-and-10 on b25. the defense can gain possession if there is evidence of a clear recovery. a.r. 15.118 completed pass, no clear recovery first-and-10 on a20. qba1 throws a forward pass to a2 near the sideline. a2 gains control of the ball, takes two steps, turns up field, and is then hit by a defender causing him to lose the ball at the a40. the loose ball is not recovered by any player. officials rule the pass incomplete. ruling: reviewable, a’s ball first-and-10 on a40, wind clock. there is no clear recovery, so the ball is awarded to team a at the spot where possession was lost. passes in end zone the rules regarding whether a pass is complete or incomplete in the field of play also apply to the end zone. the only difference is that a player cannot catch and fumble the ball in his opponent’s end zone, since the play is over once he completes the catch. act common to the game a.r 15.119 performs an act common to the game first-and-goal on b5. a1 clearly controls a pass in the end zone with both hands above his head, gets two feet completely down and tucks the ball under his arm before b3 knocks it loose. officials rule the pass incomplete. ruling: reviewable. touchdown. reset the clock to the time when a1 caught the ball. if the receiver maintains control of the ball long enough to perform an act common to the game, then it is a catch and score. a.r. 15.120 process complete before losing control first-and-goal on b5. a1 clearly controls a pass in the end zone, gets two feet completely down, tucks the ball and starts to turn before he is hit by a defender, causing him to go to the ground where he loses possession of the ball. officials rule the pass incomplete. ruling: reviewable. touchdown. if the receiver maintains control of the ball long enough to perform an act common to the game before he loses control of the ball, it is a catch and score. a.r. 15.121 does not perform an act common to the game first-and-goal on b5. a1 clearly controls a pass in the end zone, gets one foot down and just as his second foot hits the ground, he loses the ball and remains upright. officials rule the pass incomplete. ruling: reviewable. a’s ball second-and-goal on b5. incomplete pass. in this situation, the receiver did not perform an act common to the game, or maintain control of the ball long enough to do so, after his second foot touched the ground. a.r. 15.122 must perform an act common to the game after touching the ground with two feet or another body part first-and-goal on b5. a1 controls a pass near the goal line, gets one foot down, and stretches the ball out over the goal line. the ball is knocked loose just as his second foot touches the ground. the officials rule the pass complete and award a touchdown. ruling: reviewable. incomplete pass. a receiver must perform an act common to the game after touching the ground with two feet or a body part other than his hands. only the replay official can initiate a review of this play. pylon a.r. 15.123 body part touching pylon third-and-10 on b25. wide receiver a2 controls a pass and gets his left foot down inbounds in the field of play, but replays show that his right foot hits the pylon before hitting the ground inbounds in the end zone with the ball breaking the plane of the goal line. officials rule incomplete pass. ruling: reviewable. touchdown. touching a pylon with any part of his body does not put a player out of bounds. a.r. 15.124 ball touching pylon while in player control third-and-10 on b25. wide receiver a2 controls a pass and gets his left foot down inbounds in the field of play. he reaches for the pylon and the ball touches it before his right foot comes down inbounds in the end zone. officials rule an incomplete pass. ruling: reviewable. touchdown. reset the clock to the time when a2’s second foot touched the ground. when a loose ball in player control touches a pylon, it is not out of bounds even though the process of the catch is not yet complete (3-21-3). if the ball was not in player control, it would be incomplete. 17 forward progress in end zone a.r. 15.125 driven back into field of play, maintains control third-and-goal on b5. airborne receiver a2 controls a pass in the end zone where he gets contacted by a defender and driven back into the field of play where he lands and holds onto the ball. officials rule pass complete at the b1-yard line. ruling: reviewable. touchdown a. if the receiver completes the catch, he will be awarded a td. reset the clock to the time when a2 completed the catch. a.r. 15.126 continuous control after contact third-and-goal on b5. airborne receiver a2 controls a pass in the end zone where he gets contacted by a defender and driven back into the field of play where he falls to the ground. when a2 got hit, he lost control of the ball and did not regain it until he landed on the ground at the b1. replays show that the ball did not hit the ground. officials rule td. ruling: reviewable. a’s ball fourth-and-goal on b1. reset the clock to the time when a2 was down by contact, and wind the clock on the ready-for-play. the receiver must maintain continuous control after the contact in order to be awarded a score in this situation. if the ball hit the ground while loose, it would be an incomplete pass if the receiver did not complete the elements of a catch. only the replay official can initiate a review of this play. a.r. 15.127 no forward progress third-and-goal on b5. airborne receiver a2 controls a pass in the end zone and comes back into the field of play, untouched by a defender, where he lands and is tackled at the b2-yard line. officials rule td. ruling: reviewable. a’s ball fourth-and-goal on b2. reset the clock to the time when a2 was down by contact, and wind the clock on the ready-for-play. since the receiver was airborne and came back into the field of play on his own, he must get the ball back into the end zone for it to be a td. if he got two feet down in the end zone with control and the ball breaking the plane of the goal line, then it would be a touchdown even though he completed the process of the catch in the field of play. only the replay official can initiate a review of this play. qb pass or fumble replay can always review whether a player threw a forward pass or fumbled. if the passer’s hand comes forward in an obvious forward passing motion with control of the ball, it is considered a forward pass until he begins to bring the ball back toward his body. once he starts to bring the ball back to his body, any subsequent loss of control is a fumble. if there is a fumble that is ruled an incomplete pass, the ball will be awarded at the spot of recovery to the team that recovers the ball in the immediate continuing action. if on-field officials make a preliminary ruling of which team recovered the ball, that preliminary ruling constitutes a clear recovery. if there is no clear recovery, the ball will be awarded to the team last in possession at the spot where possession was lost, except that if possession was lost in the team’s own end zone, and the ball was not clearly recovered in the end zone, the ball will be placed at the one-yard line. no advance will be given. if a fumble in the end zone occurs on fourth down or after the two-minute warning, it would be a safety even if recovered in the field of play if the fumbling player clearly did not recover the ball. hand coming forward a.r. 15.128 hand coming forward with control first-and-10 on a20. qba1 is hit while passing and loses the ball. b1 recovers the ball and returns it for a touchdown. replays show a1’s hand going forward with control of the ball and that he lost it before he began to bring it back to his body. ruling: reviewable. incomplete forward pass, a’s ball second-and-10 on a20. reset the clock to the time when the ball hit the ground. only the replay official can initiate a review of this play. a.r. 15.129 fumble first-and-10 on b20. qba1 starts to bring his hand forward to throw a forward pass to receiver a3. after realizing that a3 is covered, a1 starts to bring the ball back toward his body, but before he gets it all the way back, he loses it and b77 recovers at the b27. the referee rules an incomplete pass. ruling: reviewable. fumble, b’s ball first-and-10 on b27. reset the clock to the time when b77 recovered the fumble. clear recovery a.r. 15.130 fumble with clear recovery, no advance allowed second-and-10 on a25. qba1 is hit at the a22 while attempting to throw a forward pass. the ball hits the ground at the a20 and b1 recovers it there and starts to run with it, but the referee rules incomplete pass. replays show it was a fumble. ruling: reviewable. b’s ball first-and-10 on a20, no advance allowed. a.r. 15.131 no clear recovery second-and-12 on a8. qba1 is hit while attempting to throw a forward pass, the ball hits the ground, and the referee rules it an incomplete pass. the ball was thrown from: (a) the end zone; or (b) from the a2. the loose ball goes into a pile of players from both teams at the a5. replays show that it was a fumble. b challenges the play. rulings: (a) reviewable. a’s ball third-and-19 on a1. although possession was lost in the end zone, the ball was recovered in the field of play even though it is not clear which team recovered the ball, so team a is awarded the ball at the a1-yard line. if the ball was clearly recovered in the end zone, it would be a safety. team b is not charged a timeout. if this play occurs on fourth down or after the two-minute warning, it would be a safety if qba1 clearly did not recover the ball. 18 (b) reviewable. a’s ball third-and-18 on a2. because there is no clear recovery, team a is awarded the ball at the spot where possession was lost. team b is not charged a timeout. passing motion a.r. 15.132 no forward passing motion second-and-10 on a20. qba1 is under pressure, and he brings the ball up towards his head to avoid a defender. he gets hit and the impact causes his hand to go forward, and he loses the ball and b recovers at the a17. officials rule fumble. ruling: reviewable, b’s ball first-and-10 on a17. the qb was not attempting to pass when he lost the ball, so it is a fumble regardless of whether his hand went forward or not. only the replay official can initiate a review of this play. cannot create foul after reversal a.r. 15.133 intentional grounding second-and-10 on a20. qba1 who is standing in the pocket at the a15 throws the ball into the ground at the a23 to avoid a sack. there are no eligible receivers in the area where the ball hit the ground. the referee rules fumble and b3 recovers the ball. ruling: reviewable, a’s ball third-and-10 on a20, reset the clock to the time when the ball hit the ground. this is an incomplete pass, but replay cannot create a foul for intentional grounding. the only way a foul for intentional grounding can be enforced in this situation is if the referee threw his flag and picked it up, or before the review made an announcement that grounding would be enforced if the fumble ruling is reversed to an incomplete pass. only the replay official can initiate a review of this play. qb spike to conserve time a.r. 15.134 qb spike first-and-10 on b33. after completing a pass in the field of play, team a lines up and qba1 attempts to spike the ball to stop the clock. he loses control of the ball before his hand comes forward and it hits the ground where b7 recovers it. the referee rules incomplete pass. ruling: reviewable. b’s ball first-and-10 on b33. replay can award possession to the recovering team in this situation. if there is no clear recovery, team a is awarded the ball at the spot of the fumble and there would be a 10-second runoff if the snap happened after the two-minute warning. on an attempted qb spike, replay can review whether it was a pass or a fumble, but cannot review whether the pass was forward or backward. forward/backward passes, illegal forward passes, and handoffs all illegal forward passes and handoffs are reviewable. whether a pass is forward or backward is always reviewable. a pass is forward if it first touches the ground, or anything else, at a point that is nearer the opponent’s goal line than the point where the ball leaves the passer’s hand. if it is parallel, it is a backward pass. also, if the quarterback begins his throwing motion and then is hit by a defender, it is considered a forward pass if he passes the ball, even if the ball goes backward. if a backward pass is ruled forward and incomplete on the field, after review, the ball will be awarded at the spot of recovery to the team that recovers the ball in the immediate continuing action. if on-field officials make a preliminary ruling of which team recovered the ball, that preliminary ruling constitutes a clear recovery. if there is no clear recovery, the ball will be awarded to the team last in possession at the spot where possession was lost. if the ball goes out of bounds through an end zone, it is either a touchback or a safety. if there is no clear recovery, but the ball clearly is recovered in the end zone of the team that threw the backward pass, it is a safety. forward/backward pass a.r. 15.135 backward pass, clear recovery first-and-10 on a20. qba1 throws a pass from the a15-yard line that is ruled forward and incomplete. b7 thinking the pass was backward, falls on the loose ball at the a14. replays show the pass was backward, hitting the ground at the a14. ruling: reviewable. b’s ball first-and-10 on a14. the defense can gain possession of the ball with a clear recovery. a.r. 15.136 backward pass, no clear recovery first-and-10 on a20. qba1 throws a pass from the a15-yard line that is ruled forward and incomplete. several players from both teams jump on the loose ball. b7 emerges from the pile with the ball, but on-field officials do not make a preliminary ruling on recovery. replays show the pass was backward, hitting the ground at the a14-yard line. ruling: reviewable. a’s ball second-and-15 on a15. because there is no evidence of clear recovery, the ball is awarded to team a at the spot of the backward pass. a.r. 15.137 backward pass following interception, no clear recovery in end zone second-and-5 on b25. on the first series of overtime, qba1 throws a long pass to a2, which is intercepted by b1 in the end zone. b1 runs the ball out to the b5-yard line and attempts to throw a backward pass to teammate b2. the attempted backward pass hits the ground at the b4-yard line and rolls into the end zone where players from both teams attempt to recover the ball in a pile of players. officials rule that b1 threw an illegal forward pass and award the ball to team b. replays show that the pass was backward. the replay official challenges the play. ruling: reviewable. safety. game over. team a wins. there is no clear recovery by team a, so a touchdown cannot be awarded. however, someone recovered the ball in the end zone, so it is at least a safety. the on-field ruling of an illegal forward pass is therefore reversed to a safety. 19 a.r. 15.138 backward pass out of bounds first-and-10 on a20. qba1 throws a pass from the a15-yard line that is ruled forward and incomplete. after hitting the ground, the ball goes out of bounds at the a12-yard line. replays show the pass was backward, hitting the ground at the a14-yard line. ruling: reviewable. a’s ball second-and-18 on a12, wind clock on ready. in this situation, the ball will be placed at the out of bounds spot. the ball going out of bounds is a clear recovery. a.r. 15.139 backward pass out of bounds, safety first-and-10 on a5. qba1 throws a pass from the a3-yard line that is ruled forward and incomplete. after hitting the ground, the ball hit the goal line pylon. replays show the pass was backward, hitting the ground at the a1. ruling: reviewable. safety, safety kick a20. a.r. 15.140 incomplete forward pass second-and-10 on a40. qba1 throws a pass from the a35 toward the sideline. it hits the ground at the a36 and is recovered by b56. the line judge rules the pass backward. ruling: reviewable, a’s ball third-and-10 on a40, reset the clock to the time when the ball hit the ground. only the replay official can initiate a review of this play. a.r. 15.141 forward pass, no grounding second-and-10 on b37. qba1 who is in the pocket and under pressure at the b44 throws the ball towards the sideline and it hits the ground at the b43 and then goes out of bounds. there was no eligible receiver in the area when it hit the ground. the line judge rules the pass backward. team a challenges that the pass was forward. ruling: reviewable, a’s ball third-and-10 on b37. reset the clock to the time when the ball hit the ground. in this situation, replay can overturn the ruling to a forward pass, but cannot create a foul for intentional grounding. if officials had thrown a flag initially for intentional grounding and then picked it up because of the lj’s ruling, then replay can put the flag back down, or if the referee made an announcement regarding grounding before the review, the foul would be enforced after the reversal. a.r. 15.142 reversal negates foul first-and-10 on a20. qba1 throws a swing pass to back a2 at the a18 who runs out of bounds at the a26. officials rule the pass forward and call tight end a3 for pass interference as he was blocking downfield before the pass was caught. replays show that the pass was backward. ruling: reviewable, a’s ball second-and-4 on a26. since the pass was backward, there is no foul for pass interference. this would also apply to a foul called for an ineligible player illegally downfield. a.r. 15.143 throwing motion affected first-and-10 on a20. qba1 is under pressure at the a17 and attempts to throw a forward pass to a2 near the sideline at the a24. he starts his throwing motion but is then contacted by b77 before passing the ball. the ball lands at the a14 where b99 falls on it. the referee rules incomplete pass. ruling: reviewable, a’s ball second-and-10 on a20. if the quarterback begins his throwing motion and is then contacted by a defender, causing the pass to go backward, it is still a forward pass. illegal forward pass a.r. 15.144 passer beyond the line of scrimmage first-and-10 on b20. qba1 scrambles and throws a pass from the b19 that is caught by receiver a8 for a touchdown. ruling: reviewable. illegal forward pass. a’s ball second-and-14 on b24. for it to be an illegal forward pass, the passer’s whole body and the ball must be over the line of scrimmage when he releases the ball. only the replay official can initiate a review of this play. a.r. 15.145 pass behind line of scrimmage after ball has been beyond it first-and-10 on b20. qba1 scrambles to the b19 and then back to the b21 where he throws a pass that is caught by receiver a80 in b’s end zone for a touchdown. ruling: reviewable. illegal forward pass. a’s ball second-and-15 on b25. only the replay official can initiate a review of this play. a.r. 15.146 two forward passes behind the line of scrimmage first-and-10 on b30. shotgun qba1 pitches back to a2 who runs toward the sideline, stops and throws a pass to qba1 who then throws a forward

goal line. if the ball is clearly recovered, replay can give it to the recovering team. if the ball goes out of bounds through the end zone, it is a touchback. if there is no clear recovery or the ball does not go out of bounds, the team which had the ball keeps possession at the spot where the fumbling player lost control of the ball (unless it was fourth down and the line to gain was not reached). only the replay official can initiate a review of this play. a.r. 15.172 illegal forward pass second-and-10 on b46. a1 takes a handoff and runs to the goal line. when he gets to the goal

the goal line inside the pylon during his dive. ruling: reviewable. touchdown. reset the clock to the time of the touchdown if it was wound before the review. even though the officials ruled the

the b8-yard line. replays show that a2’s left foot did not touch the sideline. ruling: not reviewable. a’s ball first-and-goal on b8. in this situation, once the officials rule the player out of bounds, replay can only look at the position of the ball in relation to the line to gain or goal line at that point. since the ball was not breaking the plane of the goal line at that point and the player had to continue running (defined as taking two or more steps) after he was ruled out of bounds to get in the end zone, this play is not reviewable. a.r. 15.187 field-goal attempt above upright fourth-and-10 on b35. a’s field-goal attempt is ruled good. replays show the ball crossed above the top of the left upright. ruling: not reviewable. in order to be reviewable, the ball must cross

loose ball through a’s end zone and over the end line. officials rule safety. ruling: not reviewable. safety, sk a20. an illegal bat is not reviewable, even if it results in a score or occurs in the end zone. timing the game clock is reviewable, and time can be put back on the clock in certain situations. if the clock operator incorrectly starts the game clock, replay can fix the error, provided the correction occurs before the next legal snap or kick. at the end of either half, if there is visual evidence of a down ending with two or more seconds remaining, but time expires on the game clock, it can be reset through a replay review. in the first half the score is not a factor, but the replay official will have some discretion based on the field position of the next snap. the offensive team’s 40-yard line will be a general guideline. in the 4th quarter the score must be within eight points (one score), and the team that is behind must put the ball in play next (either team if score is tied). the next down must be a snap from scrimmage. the clock will not be reset if the next timed down is a free kick. the game clock can also be reset if there is visual evidence of a game official beginning to signal for a called team timeout with two or more seconds remaining, but time expires on the clock. consultation with on-field officials regarding the correct status of the game clock is also permitted as part of the replay official’s customary administrative duties. the game clock will be reset to the time at the end of the play when a ruling is changed in replay, and the status of the clock will be determined by the final ruling after replay. the clock will not be reset following a replay review when the on-field ruling is not changed. there are two situations when time can be taken off the game clock following a replay review. (1) for any play that starts after the two-minute warning of either half and the correct ruling would not have stopped the clock, there will be a 10-second runoff from the time the play should have ended. if the correct ruling would have only temporarily stopped the clock (e.g., incomplete changed to catch and fumble out of bounds), there is still a potential 10-second runoff as if the clock would have continued to run. this applies regardless of whether the original on-field ruling resulted in a stopped clock or a running clock. the defense cannot decline the runoff, but either team can use a remaining timeout to prevent the runoff. (2) at the end of either half, if there is clear visual evidence of the game clock expiring before a down ended, but the game officials put time back on the game clock, it can be reset to 0:00 and the half/game will end. whether a runner’s forward progress was stopped, or a runner was down by contact in the field of play is not reviewable as it relates to the game clock. if the officials rule progress or down, and wind the clock, replay cannot review whether the clock should have been stopped. 25 game clock review a.r. 15.190 game clock starts incorrectly fourth-and-7 on a43. with the score tied, b2 fair catches a punt at the b24 with 0:50 remaining in the fourth quarter. before the next snap, the game clock starts and runs down to 0:35 before stopping again. ruling: b’s ball

at the play and sees there was one second remaining on the clock when the ball hit the ground after it was touched by b1. ruling: half over. there must be at least two seconds remaining to put time back on the game clock through a formal replay review. however, the replay official can provide clock information to on-field officials if they request administrative assistance regarding the game clock. a.r 15.193 end of half, replay official discretion second-and-4 on a22. with 0:09 remaining in the first half, team a is behind 10-0. qb a1 scrambles and throws a pass intended for a2 which

and start on the snap. 10-second runoff a.r. 15.215 reversal creates running clock, run 10 seconds first-and-10 on 50. with 1:22 remaining in the second quarter, team a is out of timeouts. qba1’s pass to receiver a8 is ruled incomplete in the middle of the field at the b35. replays show that a8 did catch the ball with 1:15 left on the clock. ruling: reviewable. a’s ball first-and-10 on b35, adjust game clock to 1:05 and wind. the clock is reset to the time when the pass was complete and then 10 seconds are run off from that point. team b could use a remaining timeout in lieu of the runoff. a.r. 15.216 reversal creates running clock, half over second-and-6 on b20. with 14 seconds remaining in the second quarter, team a is out of timeouts. qba1 completes a pass to receiver a8 who is tackled at the goal line. the officials rule td and the clock is stopped with 7 seconds remaining. the replay official stops the game after a replay comes up that clearly shows a8 was down by contact with the ball at the b1 and 9 seconds on the clock. ruling: reviewable. run 10 seconds off the clock, half over. if team a had a timeout remaining it could use it in lieu of the runoff, and it would have the ball at the b1 with 9 seconds remaining. a.r. 15.217 reversal creates running clock third-and-5 on b10. team b leads 24-20 with 0:30 remaining in the game. both teams have one timeout remaining. a1 throws a pass to a2 at the b6, and he is tackled near the b5. officials spot the ball at the b5 and award a first down. just before center a3 snaps the ball on the next play, the replay official stops the game to review the spot (0:16). replays show that the ball was at the b5½ when a2 was down by contact, and the clock was at 0:26. ruling: reviewable. a’s ball fourth-and-½ on b5½. the clock is reset to the time when a2 was down by contact (0:26) and both teams have the option of taking a team timeout to avoid the 10-second runoff. if a timeout is taken, the clock remains at 0:26 and starts on the snap. if neither team takes a timeout, then the clock is set to 0:16 and starts on the ready-for-play. the 10-second runoff rule applies regardless of whether the original ruling resulted in a stopped or a running clock. 28 a.r. 15.218 fumble out of bounds – immediate running clock third-and-goal on b10. with 0:04 remaining in the game, team b leads 16-8, and both teams have one timeout

is a fumble out of bounds at the b5. the game clock will be reset to the time when it became dead out of bounds (0:02). for plays after the two-minute warning, if there is a reversal to a running clock, or to a situation where the clock is re-started, there is a 10-second runoff. team a can use its last timeout to prevent the runoff. a.r. 15.219 line to gain ruling not changed, no clock reset third-and-10 on a30. with 1:55 remaining in a tied game, a1 runs to the a39, where he is tackled. officials spot the ball at the a38. replays show that a1 was down by contact near the a40, and the replay official challenges the play. following review, the referee re-spots the ball and measures, and the ball is just short of the a40. ruling: reviewable. a’s ball fourth-and-inches on a39. because the ruling of whether a2 made the line to gain did not change, the clock is not reset and there is no 10-second runoff. the game clock will start on the ready for play, and the play clock will start from the time it was when the game was stopped (minimum of 10 seconds). no adjustment to game clock a.r. 15.220 kick touched before going out of bounds with five seconds left in the fourth quarter, team a kicks off and the ball glances off the leg of b3 and goes out of bounds at the b5-yard line. officials rule that the ball did not touch b3 and rule a kickoff out of bounds. ruling: reviewable. b’s ball first-and-10 on b5, but in this situation, replay cannot take time off the clock, five seconds remain. non-reviewable plays involving the clock a.r. 15.221 stop or wind second-and-10 on b45. with 10 seconds remaining in the fourth quarter, team a trails 17-14 and is out of timeouts. receiver a80 catches a pass at the b35 with five seconds on the clock and attempts to get out of bounds. he

ball first-and-10 on b35 with one second remaining. whether the game clock should have stopped or not at the end of a down is not reviewable. a.r. 15.222 play clock second-and-10 on b15. with the play clock winding down qba1 receives the snap and throws a td pass to a80. replays show that the play clock expired before the snap. ruling: not reviewable. touchdown a, ko a35. timeouts if a team challenges and loses the challenge, it is charged a timeout. if a team takes a timeout and then challenges and loses, it is charged both timeouts. if a team takes a timeout to stop a running clock after the two-minute warning and a subsequent replay review results in a reversal to a stopped clock, the timeout is restored. if a team challenges a ruling that can only be challenged by the replay official, it will be charged with a timeout, but not a challenge. the play may still be reviewable by the replay official. if a team attempts to challenge any play without a timeout, a 15-yard penalty for unsportsmanlike conduct will be enforced as a foul between downs. timeout charged a.r. 15.223 on-field ruling upheld first-and-10 on a35. qba1’s pass is ruled complete at the b40. team b coach challenges the ruling, but replays show that the pass was complete. ruling: reviewable. a’s ball first-and-10 on b40. team b loses the challenge and is charged a timeout. a.r. 15.224 on-field ruling upheld—clock changed in administration second-and-5 on a35. with 8:00 remaining in the third quarter, qba1’s pass is ruled incomplete at the a40. the clock stops at 7:45. team a coach challenges the ruling. replays show that the pass was incomplete, and that the clock should have stopped at 7:54. ruling: reviewable. a’s ball third-and-5 on a35, reset clock to 7:54. team a loses the challenge and is charged a timeout. whether a challenge is successful is not affected by a clock reset as part of administration. a.r. 15.225 first down in the middle of field, status of down not changed third-and-10 on a35. a2 takes a handoff and is ruled down at the a43. team a challenges the spot claiming that it was a first down. the replays show that the correct spot was the a44. ruling: reviewable. a’s ball fourth-and-1 on a44. re-spot the ball at the a44 and start on the snap. team a loses the challenge and is charged with a timeout because the down did not change. 29 a.r. 15.226 first down spot at sideline third-and-10 on a20. a2 takes a handoff and is ruled out of bounds at the a28-yard line. team a challenges that a2 gained the first down. replays show that the ball was at the a29-yard line when a2 stepped on the sideline. ruling: reviewable. a’s ball fourth-and-1 on a29. re-spot the ball at the a29, and start on the snap. team a loses the challenge and is charged with a timeout because the down did not change. a.r. 15.227 down by contact, no clear recovery second-and-10 on a20. runner a2 gets hit and loses the ball at the a23. the officials rule a2 down by contact. the ball goes into a pile and b3 eventually comes out with it, but there was no on-field ruling of who recovered the ball. replays show that a2 lost the ball before he was down. team b challenges the play. ruling: reviewable, but when down by contact is ruled there must be a clear recovery in order to win the challenge. a’s ball third-and-7 on a23. team b loses the challenge and is charged a timeout. if on-field officials had ruled that b3 recovered the ball, that would constitute a clear recovery in replay and team b would be awarded the ball. a.r. 15.228 challenge not permitted; timeout charged first-and-10 on b46. qba1’s pass is ruled intercepted in the field of play by b3 at the b20. replays show the pass hit the ground before b3 possessed it. team a coach throws his challenge flag. ruling: reviewable. a’s ball second-and-10 on b46, charge team a with a timeout. reset the game clock to the time when the pass hit the ground. if the ruling on the field is an interception, the play cannot be challenged by either team. a timeout is automatically charged, but the play is still reviewable by the replay official. if a was out of timeouts, a 15-yard penalty would be enforced from the b46. a.r. 15.229 challenge not permitted; team out of timeouts first-and-10 on b46. qba1’s pass is ruled intercepted in the field of play by b3 at the b20. replays show the pass hit the ground before b3 possessed it. team a coach throws his challenge flag. team a has no timeouts. ruling: reviewable. a’s ball second-and-25 on a39, reverse to incomplete and enforce a 15-yard penalty from the previous spot. reset the game clock to the time when the pass hit the ground. if the ruling on the field is an interception, the play cannot be challenged by either team. a.r. 15.230 encroachment; coach throws flag without a timeout first-and-10 on a20. with 2:45 to go in the fourth quarter, a2 catches a pass at the a45. before the next snap, defensive end b7 encroaches and then the team b coach throws his challenge flag. team b is out of timeouts. ruling: reviewable, but team b cannot challenge both because it committed a foul that prevented the snap, and because it is out of timeouts. a’s ball first-and-10 on b35. in this situation, the uns is considered a foul between downs, so both fouls are enforced. a.r. 15.231 coach attempts to withdraw challenge first-and-10 on a20. qba1’s pass is ruled incomplete at the sideline at the 50. team a’s coach challenges that the pass was complete. while the referee was coming to the sideline, a replay on the video board shows the pass was incomplete. the coach then tells the referee that he doesn’t want to challenge the ruling. ruling: reviewable. a’s ball second-and-10 on a20, charge team a with a timeout. a coach cannot challenge a reviewable play and then change his mind. if the referee feels that is the case, the head coach has two choices. he can either go through with the challenge and all normal rules will apply. (if the play stands, the team loses a challenge and a timeout.) or, the coach can take a team timeout (no challenge charged). if the referee feels the coach is genuinely confused as to what is reviewable, then the referee can allow the coach to pick up the red flag with no challenge or timeout charged. timeout not charged a.r. 15.232 aspect of the play changed fourth-and-10 on a35. a1 punts to b1 at the b25-yard line. b1 returns the punt to the b32, where he is hit and fumbles. a2 recovers the ball at the b34, but is ruled out of bounds and officials award the ball to team b. team a challenges that a2 was not touching the sideline during the recovery. replays show that b1’s knee touched down before the fumble. ruling: reviewable. b’s ball first-and-10 on b32. reset the clock to the time when b1 was down by contact. this is a successful challenge and a will not be charged with a timeout because a reviewable aspect of the play was changed. the only exception to this is when a team challenges the line to gain and the ball is re-spotted, but the down remains the same. timeout inside two minutes a.r. 15.233 timeout restored; reversal creates stopped clock first-and-10 on a40. with 1:30 remaining in the fourth quarter and team a trailing 17-14, qba1 completes a pass to a2 in the middle of the field at the b42 and then calls a timeout. replays show the pass hitting the ground before a2 possessed it and the replay official initiates a review of the play. ruling: reviewable. incomplete pass, a’s ball second-and-10 on a40, reset the clock to the time when the ball hit the ground. team a’s timeout is restored. for the timeout to be restored, the timeout must have been taken to stop a running clock after the two-minute warning and there is a reversal to a stopped clock. a.r. 15.234 timeout restored; change of possession second-and-5 on a25. with 53 seconds remaining in the second quarter, qba1 throws a low pass that appears to be intercepted by b4 at the a33, but the officials rule that the ball hit the ground. during the play tackle a6 is injured and needs assistance 30 getting off the field. team a is charged an injury timeout. replays show that the ball never hit the ground and the replay official initiates a review of the play. ruling: reviewable. b’s ball first-and-10 on a33. team a’s timeout is restored because an injury timeout is not charged on a play involving a change of possession. a.r. 15.235 timeout not restored; line to gain third-and-10 on a40. with 1:52 remaining in the fourth quarter, qba1 completes a pass to a2 who runs to the 50, where he is tackled. officials mark the ball just short of the 50 making it fourth down. team a takes a timeout to decide whether to go for it and a replay comes up showing that the ball was just beyond the 50 when a2 was down by contact. the replay official initiates a review of the play. ruling: reviewable, a’s ball first-and-10 on 50, reset clock to the time when a2 was down by contact. team a’s timeout is not restored because the changed ruling to a first down did not result in a stopped clock. there is no 10-second runoff because a timeout was called after the play. fouls that prevent snap if a team commits a foul that prevents the snap, it is no longer permitted to challenge the previous play. a foul is considered to prevent the snap if it is committed after the ball is made ready for play (ball in position to be snapped and officials in position to officiate the play) and causes the play clock to stop before a snap. if the team attempts to challenge, it will be charged a timeout or uns penalty (if out of timeouts). fouls that prevent the snap will not prevent the replay official from initiating a review that would benefit the offending team. this rule applies to both offensive and defensive fouls. there is nothing a team can do to prevent a review when the replay official is responsible for initiating it. no review permitted a.r. 15.236 team fouls before next snap and challenges first-and-10 on a20. with 8 minutes to go in the third quarter, a2 catches a pass at the a45. before the next snap, defensive end b7 encroaches. after the encroachment foul, team b attempts to challenge that the pass was incomplete. ruling: reviewable, but since team b committed a foul that prevented the snap, it cannot challenge the ruling. a’s ball first- and-5 on 50. team b is charged a timeout, but not a challenge. review permitted a.r. 15.237 false start, inside two minutes first-and-10 on a20. with 1:23 left in the second quarter, qba1’s pass to a3 is ruled incomplete at the a45. before the next snap tackle a67 false starts. replays show that a3 caught the pass. ruling: reviewable, a’s ball first-and-10 on a45, the fst is ignored. reset the clock to the time when a3 caught the pass and either team can elect to use a charged team timeout to avoid a 10-second runoff from that time. when the play falls under the replay official’s jurisdiction, a foul that prevents the snap will not prevent a review. the false start is only ignored if the call is overturned. a.r. 15.238 defensive foul, offense challenges first-and-10 on b20. in the third quarter, a3 catches a pass at the b3 and gets tackled right at the goal line. the officials rule a3 down short of the goal line. before the next snap, b77 encroaches. team a then challenges that a3 scored. replays show that the ball was breaking the plane of the goal line before a3 was down and that qba1 was at the b18 when he threw the pass. ruling: reviewable. ifp, a’s ball, second-and-13 on b23, the enc is ignored. reset the clock to the time when the ball broke the plane of the goal line and start on the snap. if the team that did not commit the foul challenges the previous play, then replay can review all aspects and either team may benefit from the review. the challenge is successful because a reviewable aspect was changed. penalties replay can review whether a player touched the ball, or touched a boundary line, and fouls can be created or negated based on that information. these situations are explained in other sections of the casebook. whether 12 or more players were on the field is also reviewable. purely subjective fouls such as holding are not reviewable. penalty administration including the number of the down, yardage, and the spot of a foul is reviewable, and the normal rules pertaining to coach’s challenges and replay official reviews apply. in addition, replay officials and designated members of the officiating department can consult with the referee on administrative matters and certain objective aspects of a play (see 15-3-9). number of players on field a.r. 15.239 too many men on the field third-and-10 on b22. b7 realizes he is the twelfth player on defense and attempts to get to the sideline before the snap. at the snap, b7 was still one yard from the sideline. pass is incomplete and there are no flags on the play. ruling: reviewable. a’s ball third-and-5 on b17. all 12 men must be viewable on the screen to overturn. replay can piece different shots together to determine how many players were on the field at the snap. to be off the field, the player must have a body part touching out of bounds before the snap. 31 a.r. 15.240 too many men in the formation third-and-10 on b22. b1 intercepts a pass and returns it for a touchdown. before the snap, b had 12 players in the formation, but no foul was called, and the snap was allowed. ruling: reviewable. a’s ball third-and-5 on b17. replay can review the number of players on the field at the snap even though officials did not call a foul for too many men in formation. if this foul is created in replay it is enforced as a live ball foul. only the replay official can initiate a review of this play. a.r. 15.241 too many men in the formation, play shut down before snap second-and-10 on b40. the side judge shuts the play down just before the snap, ruling that team b had 12
