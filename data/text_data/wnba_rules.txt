indicate the spot of the throw -in. 
If a violation has occurred the official will indicate: (1)  the nature of the violation by 
giving the correct signal, (2) the number of the offender, if applicable, and (3) the direction

(7) Officials are not reasonably certain as to which team should be awarded possession  after a ball becomes out -of-bounds or whether a  called  out-of-bounds 
in fact occurred during the last two minutes o f the fourth period or last two 
minutes of any o vertime period(s). Officials  also may award the ball to the team 
that last touched the ball if the ball going out -of-bounds was clearly caused by an 
obvious foul on the team that did  not last touch the ball during the last two minutes 
of the fourth period or last two minutes of  any overtime period(s).  
(8) Officials are not reasonably certain whet her a successful field goal was 
released or a called foul was committed prior  to expiration of the shot clock.  
(9) Officials are not reasonably certain whether a pe rsonal foul called at any time 
during a game met the criteria for a clear -path-to-the-basket foul.  
(10) Officials are not reasonably certain as to w hich player should attempt free 
throws on a called foul.  
(11) Officials are not reasonably certain whether t he ball tou ched the rim and thus 
whether the shot clock or game clock should be adjusted during the last two 
minutes of the fourth period or last two minutes of any overtime period(s).  
(12) Officials have determined that illegal contact has occurred on a b lock/charge  
foul but are not reasonably certain as to whether the defender was inside or outside 
the restricted area during the last two minutes of the fourth period or last two minutes of any overtime period(s).  -54- 
 (13) Officials are not reasonably certain w hether a goa ltending or basket 
interference violation was called correctly during the  last two minutes of the 
fourth period or last two minutes of any overtime period(s).  
 (14) Officials are not reasonably certain whether (a) an off-ball foul occurred 
prior to an offensive player beginning her shootin g motion on a successful basket 
if the off- ball foul is committed by a defensive player, (b) a defensive foul was  
committed prior to the ball being released on a  throw -in or (c) the ball was  
released on a successful field goal if the off -ball fou l is a double foul or committed 
by an offensive player.  
(15) Officials are not reasonably certain whether a  team had the correct number 
of players on the court while the b all is in play.  
b. Instant replay would NOT be used to check a successf ul basket in Section I above 
if the throw -in, free throw attempt , or jump ball started with .2 or .1 on the game clock. 
The officials will judge the legality of the basket in these situ ations  based on the guidelines 
as set fo rth in Comments on the Rules L.  
Section II —Reviewable Matters

in the A ltercation and the action immediately prior to and immediately following 
the Altercation.  
(2) The level of involvement of each such player , coach, trainer, or team bench 
person . 
(3) The appropriate penalty to be assessed against each such player , coach, trainer, 
or team bench person . 
e. If an instant replay review is triggered as describ ed in Section I —a (5) above, the

ii. If the ball is released on an unsuccessful field goal at tempt or is loose when 
the horn or whistle sounds, the ball w ill be jumped at center circle b etween 
any two opponents in the game.  
iii. If the horn or whistle sounds while a successful field goal is in flight, the 
opposing team will inbound on the baseline as after any successful field goal.  
f. If an instant replay review is triggered as described in Sect ion I —a (6) above, the 
officials will review the video to determine the following issues:  
(1) Whether the successful field goal was scored correct ly as a two -point or three -
point field goal. Prior to the secon d regular  timeout in the fourth period, the review 
must take place at the next timeout or period break following the basket in 
question.  
If the next break is halftime, the review must ta ke place prior to the officials 
leaving the court.  
Following the secon d regular  timeout in the fourth peri od and any overtime 
period, the review must take place at the next clock stoppage, includin g 
immediately upon a successful basket when the clock stops in the last two 
minutes. If a s uccessful two -point/three -point field goal is not reviewed in -57- 
 accordance with the foregoin g timing rules, the play can no longer be reviewed 
once the ball is inbounded and touched o n the court, a personal foul is assessed or 
violation is whistled.  
(2) Whether the shooter fouled was attempting a two -point or three -point field 
goal.  
During the entire game, the review must take place prior to the shooter releasing 
the first free throw attempt.  
The officials may also review the video to determine only the following other 
matters:  
(3) If the shot wa s timely, whether the shooter comm itted a boundary line 
violation or the ball touched out -of-bounds prior to entering the basket or, in the 
case of a foul, whether the player fouled committed a bounda ry line violation. For 
purposes of this review, the offi cial would look only at the position of the player’s 
feet at the moment they last touched the floor immediate ly prior to (or, if 
applicable, during) the release of the shot or the foul (as applicable).  
(4) Whether the shot clock expired before the ball lef t the shooter’s hand or  the 
foul occurred.  
(5) Whether any unsportsmanlike acts or unnecessary contact occurred.  
g. If an instant replay review is triggered as describ ed in Section I —a (7) above, the 
officials w ill review the video to determine which team should be awarded possession.  
The review must take place prior to the subsequent inbounding  of the ball or, if 
applicable, jump ball.  
The officials may also review the video to determine only the following other matters:  
(1) Whether time on the game clock expired prior to the ball being out -of-bounds.  
(2) Whether the shot clock expired prior to the ball being out -of-bounds.  
(3) Whether an 8 -second backcourt violation occurred prior to the ball being out -
of-bounds.  
(4) How much time remains i n the period and/or on the shot clock. 
(5) Whether any unsportsmanlike acts or unnecessary contact occurred.  
h. If an instant replay review is triggered as describ ed in Section I —a (8) above, the 
officials w ill review the video to determine the following i ssues:

Prior to the second regular  timeout i n the fourth period, the review must take place 
at the next timeout or period break following the basket in question.  
If the nex t break is halftime, the review must ta ke place prior to the officials 
leaving the court. Following the second regular  timeout in the fourth period and -58- 
 any overtime period, the review will take pl ace at the next clock stoppage, 
including immediately upon a  successful basket when the cloc k stops in the last 
two minutes. If a shot clock violatio n is not reviewed in accordance with the 
foregoing timing rules, it may not be reviewed thereafter.  
(2) Whether a called foul that is not committed on or by a player i n the act of 
shooting occurred prior to the expiration of time on the shot clock.

(ii) whe ther the shooter released the ball prior to the expiration of time on the shot 
clock if the foul occurr ed after the expiration of time on the shot clock.  
During the entire game, the review of a foul occurr ing as the shot clock expires 
must take place prior to the shooter releasing the first  free throw attempt or prior 
to the subsequent inbounding of the ball.  
The officials may also review the video to determine only the following other 
matters:  
(4) If the shot was timely, whether the successful fie ld goal was scored correctly 
as a two -point or three -point field goal or, in the c ase of a shooting foul, whether 
the shooter fouled was attempting a two -point or three -point field goal.  
(5) If the shot was timely, whether the shooter comm itted a boundary line  
violation or the ball touched out -of-bounds prior to entering the basket or, in the 
case of a foul, whether the player fouled committed a boundary line violation. For 
purpo ses of this review, the official would look only at the position of the player’s 
feet at the moment they last touched the floor immediate ly prior to (or, if 
applicable, during) the release of the shot or the foul (as applicable).  
(6) Whether an 8 -second backcourt violation oc curred before the ball left the 
shooter’s hand or the player wa s fouled.  
NOTE: In all the above, the officials would be perm itted to utilize instant replay 
to determine whether (and how much) time shou ld be put on the game clock but 
only when it is determined through replay that (i) the player committed a boundary 
line violation, (ii) a shot clock  violation occurr ed, (iii) an 8 -second backcourt 
violation occurred, (iv) a called foul occurred pri or to the expiration of time on 
the game clock or (v) a clock malfunction o ccurred and time remains in the period.  
(7) Whether any unsportsmanlike acts or unnecessary contact occurred.  
i. If an instant replay review is triggered as described in Sect ion I —a (9) above, the 
officials will review the video to determine the following issues:  
(1) Whe n the foul was called, the ball is ahead the tip of the circle in the backcourt, 
no defender is ahead of the offensive player with the scoring opportunity and that offensive player is in control of the ball or a pass to her has been released.  -59- 
 (2) The foul deprived the offensive team of a tra nsition scoring opportunity.  
(3) The foul was committed prior to the offensive player starting her shooting 
motion.  
(4) The foul was caused by the defender’s attempt to intercept or deflect a pass 
intended for the player with the transition scoring opportu nity. 
(5) Whether any unsportsmanlike acts or unnecessary contact occurred.  
j. If an instant replay review is triggered in Section I —a (10) above, the officials w ill 
review the video to determine which player was fouled. The review must take place pr ior 
to the first free throw being released. The officials would not review video to determine 
which player committed the foul in question.  
The officials may review the video to determine only the following other matters:  
(1) Whether the shooter fouled was attempting a two -point or three -point field 
goal.  
(2) Whether the player fouled committed a boundary line violation prior to the 
foul. 
For purposes of this review, the official w ill look only at the position of the 
player’s feet at the moment they last tou ched the floor immediately prior to (or, if 
applicable, during) the foul.  
(3) Whether the shot clock expired before the foul occurred.  
(4) Whether an 8 -second backcourt violation occurred before the player was 
fouled.  
(5) Whether any unsportsmanlike acts or unnecessary contact occurred.  
k. If an instant replay review is triggered in Secti on I—a (11) above, the officials will 
review the video to determine whether the ball touched the  rim, and make any adjustments 
to the game clock, shot  clock, score,  and possession tha t are appropriate in accordance with 
the following:  
(1) If play has stopped following the offensive team retaining possession (e.g., the 
offensive team has made a successful field goal, or a violation or foul has been 
calle d), the play must be reviewed immediately upon such stoppage of play and:  
(i) For a successful field goal, the officials will time the play to determine 
whether the field goal was released prior to the e xpiration of 24 seconds or 
allowable time. If the off icials deter mine that the ball was released before 24 
seconds or allowable time exp ired, the points will count and the opposing 
team will inbound on the b aseline as after any successful field goal. If the 
officials determine that the ball was released after the shot clock should have 
expired, the points will not count and the opposing team will be awarded the 
ball at the free throw line extended.  -60- 
 (ii) For a called foul, the officials will time the play to  determine whether the 
foul occurred prior to the exp iration of 24 seconds or allowable time or, in 
the case of a called foul that is comm itted on a player in the act of shooting, 
whether the shooter released the ball prior to the expiration of 24 seconds or 
allowable time. If the of ficials determine that th e foul occurred or the ball 
was released prior to the expiration of 24 seconds or allowable time, the 
called foul will be uph eld. If the officials determine that the foul occurred,  or 
the ball was released after the expiration of 24  seconds or allowable time, the 
calle d foul will be overturned and a shot clock violation assessed.  
(EXCEPTION: Flagrant fouls and unsportsmanlike acts and points scored 
therefrom will not be nullified.)  
(iii) If the ball is caused to become out- of-bounds by the defen sive team or a 
defensive violation is assessed, the officials will time the play to determine 
how much time should be on t he shot clock or if a shot clock  violation should 
be assessed.  
(2) If play is continuous (i.e., if there is no stoppage in play follow ing the offensive 
team retaining possession of the ball), the officials will stop play during the first 
pause in action prior to any subsequent change of possession. If the officials 
determine following review that the shot clock is correct (i.e., no adjus tment is 
required), then play will resume from the point of  interruption. If the officials 
determine that the shot clock is incorrect, then the shot clock will be reset to the time the ball was possessed by the offensive team following the ball touching (o r 
not touching) the rim, and the game clock will also be reset to reflect the change.  
The ball will be inbounded on the sideline near est the spot where the ball was 
possessed.  
 (3) If play is stopped while neither team is in possessio n of the ball and the 
officials determine following review that a shot clock  violation has not occurred, 
then play will resume with a jump ball at center court between any two opponents 
in the game. The shot clock and game clock will be adjusted accordingly.  
If an instant repla y review for a shot clock adjustmen t is not reviewed in 
accordance with the timing rules set forth above, it m ay not be reviewed at any 
point thereafter.  
(4) Whether any unsportsmanlike acts or unnecessary contact occurred.  
l. If an instant replay review i s triggered as describe d in Section I —a (12) above, the 
officials w ill review the video to determine:  
(1) Whether the defender was inside or outside the restricted area.  
(2) Whether the defender was in a legal guarding position.  
(3) Whether any unsportsmanlike acts or unnecessary contact occurred.  -61- 
 m. If an instant replay review is triggered as describe d in Section I —a (13) above, the 
officials w ill review the video in accordance with Rule 11 —Section I. The officials may 
also review the video to d etermine only the following matters: 
(1) If goaltending or basket interference was ruled prio r to the ball touching the 
rim, whether the shooter committed a boundary line violation. For purposes of 
this review, the official w ill look only at the positi on of the shooter’s feet at the 
moment they last touched the floor immediately prior  to (or, if applicable, during) 
the release of the shot and the flight of the ball.  
(2) If goaltending or basket interference was ruled prio r to the ball touching the 
rim, whet her an 8 -second backcourt violation oc curred before the ball left the 
shooter’s hand.  
(3) Whether any unsportsmanlike acts or unnecessary contact occurred.  
n. If an instant replay review is triggered as describe d in Section I —a (14) above, the 
officials w ill review the video to determine:  
(1) Whether the shot clock expired before the foul occurred.  
(2) Whether an 8 -second backcourt violation occurred before the player was 
fouled.  
(3) Whether any unsportsmanlike acts or unnecessary  contact occurred. 
o. If an instant replay review is triggered as described in Section I —a(15) above, the 
officials w ill review the video in accordance with Rule 12 A—Section III.  
p. The officials may also review the video to determ ine whether any unsportsm anlike 
acts o r unnecessary contact occurred. 
Section III —Replay Review Process  
a. Replay reviews are to be conducted by the officials as  a crew after gathering as 
much information as possible. In cases of conflict, the Crew Chief will make the final 
decision.  
b. Replay reviews should be conducted within two minute s. Notwithstanding this 
general rule, discretion will be used to extend the review perio d as reasonably necessary 
under unusual circumstances, such as when the play could lead  to an ejection (e.g., flagrant 
fouls/penalty 2), technical issues arise with the replay sy stem, the outcome of the replay 
review requires multiple replay review angles or additional angles are imminent. In 
addition,  replay reviews of Player Altercations should be conclud ed within whatever time 
is reasonably  necessary, even if that time period extends beyond two minutes.  
c. If the replay system is not functioning properly, or not av ailable, the officials will 
use the nearest courtside broadcast production TV monitor availa ble. 
d. Following replay review, the crew will make a ru ling. The call made by the game 
officials during play will be reversed only when the replay pro vides the officials with "clear -62- 
 and conclusive" visual evidence to do so. For clock malfunctio ns, the off icials will not 
make a ruling prior to using replay.  
e. The officials will use the following to make their ruling in the order listed below 
regarding scoring, timing , or fouls at the end of any period:  
(1) Game clock or shot clock on top of backboard.  
(2) LED lights.  
(3) Game clock on the facades of the balcony.  
(4) Game clock on scoreboards hanging from the ceiling.  
(5) Superimposed TV clocks.  
EXCEPTION: Clock malfunctions when clocks start ea rly, late , or freeze – 
Officials will use replay clock superimpo sed from TV production or stop watch.  
f. The officials will keep both teams on the court at the end of the second perio d if 
replay is being used to determine if a foul was called prior to  expiration of the period or if 
there is any question whether the sho oter committed a shot clock  violation, 8 -second 
violation or boundary line violation where time may be added to the game clock.  
g. The officials will keep both teams on the court any ti me replay is used at the end of 
the fourth period or overtime period.  
 
 
COMMENTS ON THE RULES  
I. GUIDES FOR ADMINISTRATION AND APPLICATION OF  
THE RULES  
Each official should have a definite and clear conception of his/her overall 
responsibilities.  
It is essential for them to know, understand , and implemen t the rules as intended. If all 
officials possess the same conception there will be guaranteed u niformity in the 
administration of all contests.  
The restrictions placed upon the player by the rules are intended to create a balance of 
play, equal opportunit y for the defense and the offense, provide reasonable safety and 
protection  for all players and emphasize cleverness and skill wit hout unduly limiting 
freedom of action of players or teams.  
The purpose of penalties is to compensate a player who ha s been pl aced at a 
disadvantage through an illegal act of an opponent and to restrai n players from committing 
acts which, if ignored, might lead to roughness even though t hey do not affect the 
immediate play.  
 -63- 
 II. BASIC PRINCIPLES  
A. CONTACT SITUATIONS  
1. Incidental Contact  
The mere fact that contact occurs does not necessarily constitute a foul. Contact which 
is incidental to an effort by a player to play an opponent, reach a loose ball, or perform 
normal defensive or offensive movements, should not be con sidered illegal. If, however, a  
player attempts to play an opponent from a position where she has no reasonable chance to 
perform without making contact with her opponent, the responsi bility is on the player in 
this position.  
The hand is considered “part o f the ball” when it is in co ntact with the ball. Therefore, 
contact on that hand by a defender while it is in contac t with the ball is not illegal.  
2. Guarding an Opponent  
In all guarding situations, a player is entitled to any spot on the court she desire s, 
provided she legally gets to that spot first and without contact with an opponent.  If a 
defensive or offensive player has established a position on the floor and  her opponent 
initiates contact that results in dislodging, a foul should be called IMMEDIAT ELY.  
During all throw -ins, the defensive player(s) must be allowed to take a position  
between her opponent and the basket.  
A player may continue to move after gaining a guarding posi tion in the path of an 
opponent provided she is not moving directly or obliquely t oward her opponent when 
contact occurs. A player is never permitted to move into the path of  an opponent after the 
opponent has started her upward jumping motion.  
A player who extends a hand, forearm, shoulder, hip , or leg into the path of an 
opponent and thereby causes contact is not considered to have a legal position in the path 
of an opponent.  
A player is entitled to a vertical position even to the e xtent of jumping straight -up or 
holding her arms above her shoulders,  as in post play or when double -teaming in pressing 
tactics.  
Any player who conforms to the above is absolved from  responsibility for any contact 
by an opponent which may dislodge or tend to dislodge such  player from the position which 
she has attained and  is maintaining legally. If contact occurs, the official must decide 
whether the contact is incidenta l or a foul has been committed.  
3. Screening  
A screener is any player with or without the ball, facing in any direction, who delays 
or prevents an opponent  from reaching her desired position by estab lishing a legally 
obtained position on the floor according to certain screening action guidelines . -64- 
 Once a screener legally obtains her position on the flo or where contact may ultimately 
occur, to be considered a legal screener, she must (1) have her legs /feet balanced so that 
she can move in any direction, with the inside of her legs/feet at ab out shoulder -width (i.e. , 
a foot cannot be outside shoulder -width, and/or she cannot be in a n unnatural/imbalanced 
stance) , (2) have her arms near the front of her body (i.e. , she cannot  extend them out), (3) 
have her elbows extended to the sides no further than when her wrist s are touching in the 
center of her body, and (4) not grab, hold, push or unnaturally restrict an opponent’s 
movement.  
A legal screener can be moving to firm up her position when  contact occurs if the 
movement is in her chest, shoulders , or hips and she absorbs the c ontact from the oncoming 
player and does not deliver the contact (e.g. , by turning with t he opponent rather resisting 
or restricting her movement or softening her stance to allow t he opponent to move through 
the screen); or legs or feet and the contact occurs to the screener’s upper body  (chest, 
shoulder, etc.), and not in her le gs or feet.  
To establish a legally obtained position on the floor in the path of an opponent who is  
stationary when the screen is being set in an area that could b e visible to the opponent being 
screened, the screener does not need to give her opponent  any room, but the screener may 
not initiate contact.  
If a screen is being set outside the stationary opponent’ s field of vision, the screener 
must give her opponent room to take a step towards her; or moving, the screener must allow 
her opponent enough room t o avoid the screen. This dis tance depends upon the SPEED of 
the moving opponent being screened.  
If two opponents are moving in the same direction and pa th, the player who is behind 
is responsible for contact. The player in front may stop or slow  her pace, but she may not 
move backward or sideward into her opponent. The player in front may or may not have 
the ball.  
This situation assumes the two players have been moving in  identically the same 
direction and path before contact.  
If the above criteria are met, any contact by the legal screening player is deemed 
incident al in the player’s  effort to screen her opponent.  
4. The Dribble  
If the dribbler’s path is blocked, she is expected to pass or  shoot; that is, she should 
not try to dribble past an opponent unless there is a reasonable chance of getting by without 
contact.  
 
B. FOULS: FLAGRANT—UNSPORTSMANLIKE  
To be unsportsmanlike is to act in a manner unbecomi ng to the image of professional 
basketball. It consists of acts of deceit, disrespect of off icials , and profanity. The penalty -65- 
 for such action is a technical foul. Repeated acts shall result  in expulsion from the game 
and potentially a fine.  
A flagrant foul —penalty (1) is unnecessary contact c ommitted by a player against an 
opponent.  
A flagrant f oul—penalty (2) is unnecessary and e xcessive contact committed by a 
player against an opponent. It is an unsportsmanlike act and th e offender is ejected 
following confirmation by instant replay review.  
The offender will be subject to a fine and/or suspen sion by the Commissioner . See 
Rule 12B—Section IV fo r interpretation and penalties.  
C. BLOCK -CHARGE  
A defensive player is permitted to establish a legal guarding position in the path of a 
dribbler regardless of her speed and distance.  
A defensive player is not permitted to move into the path of an offensive player once 
she has started her upward motion to attempt a field goal or pass.  
A defensive player must allow a moving player the op portunity to avoid contact when 
the offensive player receives a  pass outside the lower def ensive box. The lower defensive 
box is the area between the 3 -foot posted -up marks, the bottom tip of the circle , and the 
endline.  
A defensive player must allow an airborne player the opp ortunity to land and then 
avoid contact wh en the offensive player is outside the lower defensive box.  
A defensive player is permitted to establish a legal guar ding position in the path of an 
offensive player who receives a pass inside the lower defens ive box regardless of her speed 
and distance.  
A defensive player must allow an airborne player who receives a pass the space to land  
when the offensive player is inside the lower defensive box.  
A player must allow a moving opponent without the ball t he opportunity to avoid 
contact if she moves into her  path. 
The speed of the player will determine the amount of distance an opponent must allow.  
If an offensive player causes contact with a defensive pla yer who has established a 
legal position, an offensive foul shall be called and no points ma y be scored. A defensive 
player may turn slightly to protect herself but is never allowe d to bend over and submarine 
an opponent.  
An offensive foul should not be called for charging if the contact is with a secondary 
defensive player who has established a defensive pos ition within a design ated “restricted 
area” near the basket for the purpose of drawing an offensive foul. The offensive player 
must take a path directly to the rim. The “restricted area” for this  purpose is the area 
bounded by an arc with a 4 -foot radius m easured from the center of the basket ring.  -66- 
 EXCEPTION: Any player may be legally positioned with in the “restricted area” if the 
offensive player receives the ball within the Lower Defensive Box.  
The mere fact that contact occurs on these type of plays, or any other similar pla y, 
does not necessarily mean that a personal foul has been commi tted. The officials must 
decide whether the contact is negligible and/or incidental, judging each situation 
separately.  
An offensive foul shall be assessed if the player i nitiates contact in a  non-basketball 
manner (leads with her foot, an unnatural extended knee, etc.).  
D. GAME POSTPONEMENT AND CANCELLATIONS  
The decision to postpone or cancel a game can only be m ade by the League Office, 
after consultation with the affecte d teams. 
Before a game begins, a game may be postponed or canc eled for issues related to the 
condition of the playing court or arena, or a general or  forecasted condition involving 
weather, travel, civil unrest, natural disaster, or other event.  
The follow ing factors will be considered in det ermining whether a game will be 
postponed or canceled:  
(1) The whereabouts of teams and game officials (inclu ding the efforts that have 
been made or can be made to get these participants to the game site).  
(2) Whether sufficient team and arena staff are ava ilable to operate the arena and 
conduct the game.  
(3) Input from both teams.  
(4) The safety of game participants, team and arena staff, and fans.  
(5) Communications with state or local government officials and  law 
enforcement.  
(6) The ability to reschedule the game. 
(7) Any other factor that the WNBA deems relevant to the decision.  
After a game has begun, the decision to postpone o r cancel that game will be made 
using the factors listed above. However, the determination of whether to delay the game 
while the decision is being made is within the authority of the game officials (in 
consultation with the League Office).  
E. PHYSICAL CONTACT —SUSPENSION  
Any player or coach guilty of intentional physical contact wi th an official shall 
automatically be suspended without pay for one game. A fine and/or longer period of 
suspension will  result if circumstances so dictate.  
 -67- 
 F. PROTEST 
Protests are not permitted during the course of a game. In order to file a protest, a t eam 
must adhere to the following procedure:  
(a) In order to protest against or appeal from the result  of a game, notice thereof must 
be given to the Commissioner within forty -eight (48) hours after the conclusion of said 
game, by fax or e -mail, stating the rein the grounds for protest. No pro test may be filed in 
connection with any game played during the regular season after midnight  of the day of 
the last game of the regular season schedule. A protest in connection with a p layoff game 
must be filed not later than midnight of the day of the game protested. A game may be 
protested only by a Governor, Alternate Governor, or the Head Coach. The right of protest 
shall inure not only to the immediately allegedly aggrieved contestants but to  any other 
team who can show an interest in the grounds of protest and the results that might be 
attained if the protest were allowed. Each fax or e -mail of protest shall be immediat ely 
confirmed by letter, and no protest shall be valid unless the letter of confirmation is 
accomp anied by a check in the sum of $5000 payable to the WNBA. If the team filing the 
prote st prevails, the $5000 is to be refunded. If the team does not prevail, the $5000 is to 
be forfeited and retained by the WNBA.  
(b) Upon receipt of a protest, the Commissioner  shall at once notify the opposing team 
in the game protested and require both of said teams within five (5) days  to file with her 
such evidence as she may desire bearing upon the issue. The Commissioner  shall  decide 
the qu estion raised within five (5) days after receipt of such evidence.  
G. SHATTERING BACKBOARDS  
Any player whose contact with the basket ring or ba ckboard causes the backboard to 
shatter will be penalized in the following manner:  
(1) Pre -game and /or Half -time warm -ups—No penalty to be assessed by officials.  
(2) During the game —Non -unsportsmanlike conduct technic al foul. Under no 
circumstances will that player be ejected from the game.  
The Commissioner  will review all actions and plays involved in the shattering of a 
backboard.  
H. PLAYER/TEAM CONDUCT AND DRESS  
(1) Each player when introduced, prior to the game, must be uniformly dressed.  
(2) Players, coaches , and trainers are to stand and line up i n a dignified posture 
along the sidelines or on the foul line during the playing of the National Anthem.  
(3) Coaches and assistant coaches must wear business at tire or other apparel as 
may be designated by the WNBA.  
(4) While playing, players must keep their uniform shirt s tucked into their shorts, 
and no T-shirts are allowed.  -68- 
 (5) The only article bearing a commercial logo which can be worn by players is 
their shoes, subject to WNBA rules.  
I. OFFENSIVE 3 -SECONDS  
The offensive player cannot be allowed in the 3 -second lane for more than the allotted 
time. This causes the defensive player to “hand -check” because s he cannot control the 
offensive player for that extended period of time.  
If the offensive player is in th e 3-second lane for less than three seconds and receives 
the ball, she must make a move toward the basket for the offici al to discontinue his/her 
three -second count. If she attempts to back the defensive player down  to secure a better 
position in relation to the basket, offensive three seconds or an offens ive foul must be 
called. If she passes off and immediately makes a move out of the la ne, there should be no 
whistle.  
J. PLAYER CONDUCT —SPECTATORS  
Any coach, player , or trainer who deliberately enters the s pectator stands during the 
game will be automatically ejected and the incident reported via e -mail to the 
Commissioner . 
Entering the stands to keep a ball in play by a player or  the momentum which carries 
the player into the stands is not considered delibe rate. The first  row of seats is considered 
the beginning of the stands.  
K. FIGHTING 
Violent acts of any nature on the court will not be tolerated. P layers involved in 
altercations will be ejected, fined , and/or suspended.  
There is absolutely no justificati on for fighting in a WNBA game. The fact that a 
player believes she was provoked by another player is not an acceptab le excuse. If a player 
takes it upon herself to retaliate, she can expect to be su bject to appropriate penalties.  
L. EXPIRATION OF TIME 
NO LESS THAN 0:00.3 must expire on the game clock when a ball is thrown inbounds 
and then hit instantly out -of-bounds. If less than  0:00.3  expires  in such a situation, the timer 
will be instructed to deduct AT LEAST 0:00.3  from the game cl ock. If, in the j udgment of 
the official, the play took longer than 0:00.3 , he/she will instruct th e timer to deduct more 
time. If less than 0:00.3  remain on the game clock when this situation occurs, the period is 
over.  
The game clock must show  0:00.3  or more in order for  a player to secure possession 
of the ball on a rebound or throw -in to attempt a field goal. Instant replay shall be utilized 
if the basket is successful on this type of play and the clock runs to 0:00.  
The only type of field goal which may be scored if the gam e clock is at  0:00.2  or 0:00.1  
is a “tip -in” or “high lob.”  -69- 
 A “tip -in” is defined as any action in which the ball is deflected, not controlled, by a 
player and then enters the basket ring. This type of action shall be deemed legal if  0:00.1  
or more remains in a period.  
A “high lob” is defined as a pass which is tipped by an of fensive player while in midair, 
and is followed instantaneously by a field goal attempt. I f the reception of the pass and the 
subsequent “slam dunk” is immediately adjacent to t he basket ring, this type of action shall 
be deemed legal if 0:00.1  or more remains in a per iod. However, if the “high lob” attempt 
is a distance from the basket ring whereby the ball  must be controlled in mid -air, either 
one-handed or two -handed, a minimu m of 0:00.3  is necessary for a field goal to score if 
successful. Instant replay would NOT be used if the play starts with  0:00.2 or  0:00.1 on the 
game clock.  
NO LESS than  0:00.3  must expire on the game clock when  a player secures possession 
of an unsuccessful free throw attempt and immediately requests  a timeout. If LESS than  
0:00.3 expires in such a circumstance, the time on the game clock shall be reduced by at 
least 0:00.3 . 
Therefore, if 0 :00.3 OR LESS remain o n the game clock when the above situation 
exists, and a player requests a timeout upon securing possession of the ball, the period is over.  
Regardless of when the horn or red light operates to signify t he end of period, the 
officials (as aided by instant r eplay, if required) will ultimately make the final decision 
whether to allow or disallow a successful field goal. THE CREW CHIEF MUST TAKE 
CHARGE OF THE SITUATION.  
M. VERBAL FAN INTERFERENCE  
Any spectator who verbally abuses players and/or co aches in a manner which, in the 
opinion of the game officials, interferes with the ability of a coach to com municate with 
his/her players during the game and/or huddles, will, at the direction of the Crew Chief, be 
given one warning by a building security officer. If the sam e spectator continues to behave 
in a like manner, the crew chief shall direct a building security  officer to eject the spectator 
from the arena only after confirmation that proper warning has been given.  
N. GUIDELINES FOR INFECTION CONTROL  
If a player suffers a laceration or a wound where bleeding  occurs, or if blood is visible 
on a player or her uniform, the officials shall suspend the g ame at the earliest appropriate 
time and allow a maximum of 30 seconds for treatment. After that time,  the head coach 
shall be informed that he/she has the option to substitute for the player, call a regular 
timeout or a 20 -second timeout. If a substitute replaces the player, the op posing team shall 
be allowed to substitute one player. The bleeding player may return to  the game when she 
has received appropriate treatment by medical staff personnel.  
A team will not be given an additional 30 seconds s hould the bleeding occur from a 
wound which reopened, which is not the result of additional contact.  -70- 
 If the pl ayer returns to the game, the officials shall make  certain that any lesion, 
wound , or dermatitis is covered with a dressing that will prevent con tamination to and/or 
from other sources. A wrist or sweatband is not considered a suitable bandage.  
If the bleeding player is awarded a free throw attempt(s) as a result of a personal foul 
or is involved in a jump ball, the bleeding player will be giv en 30 seconds for treatment. If 
the treatment is not completed, play will resume and will  then be suspend ed at the first 
appropriate time. 
Mandatory timeouts shall not be granted during a suspension of play unless the 
offen sive team calls a 20 -second timeout. If the suspension of pl ay is for a defensive player, 
a mandatory timeout shall not be granted i f the defensive team calls a 20 -second timeout.  
If treatment is not completed within the allotted time, the head coach may call another 
timeout or substitute for the bleeding player. Substitutes are per mitted consistent with 
existing rules on substitution.  
If a team has no timeouts remaining when play is suspended, the officials will allow  
30 seconds for appropriate treatment. If the treatment  is not completed in accordance with 
the first paragraph of Comments on the Rules -  Section  II - N, the bleeding player mu st be 
removed immediately. ONLY the bleeding player on that team may be removed from the 
game under these circumstances.  
If so, the opposing team may also substitute one player.  
The offensive team will receive a full eight seconds to advance the b all into the 
frontcourt.  
The shot clock will remain as is or reset to 14, whichever is greater.  
O. DEAD BALL, LIVE BALL, BALL IS ALIVE  
After the ball has been dead, it is put into play by a jump  ball, throw -in, or a free throw 
attempt. The game clock does not start until the ball is le gally touched on the court by a 
player. However, any floor violation or personal foul which may occur will be penalized.  
The ball is live when it is placed at the disposal of the th rower -in, free throw shooter , 
or is tossed by  the official on a jump ball. Illegal contact, which occurs prior to the ball 
becom ing live, will be ignored if it is not unsportsmanlike.  
The ball is alive when it is legally tapped by one of t he participants of a jump ball, 
released by a thrower -in, or released on a free throw at tempt that will remain in play.  
P. TAUNTING  
If a player blatantly taunts an opponent, a technical foul shall be assessed. The 
opponent WILL NOT, automatically, be assessed a technical foul. Her b ehavior will be the 
determining factor. 
Simultaneous taunting is a verbal altercation. Verbal altercations and unsports manlike 
conduct will be administered as a double technical foul and no free throws will be attempted.  -71- 
 Technical fouls assessed opponents during the same dead ball  and prior to the 
administering of any free throw attempt for the first technical foul, shall be interpreted as 
a double technical foul.  
A PLAYER(S) GUILTY OF TAUNTING MUST BE SINGLED OUT AND PENALIZED.  
If a previous unsportsmanlike act has been committed and if this situation is 
BLATANT, a technical foul must be assessed and the gu ilty player(s) must be ejected.  
Q. FLAGRANT FOULS CRITERIA  
a. The severity of the contact;  
b. Whether or not the player was making a legitimate b asketball play (e.g., whether a 
player is making a legitimate effort to block a shot; note, however, that a foul committed 
during a block attempt can still be considered flagrant if othe r criteria are present, such as 
recklessness and hard contact to the head);  
c. Whether, on a foul commi tted with a player’s arm or  hand, the fouling player wound 
up and/or followed through after making contact;  
d. The potential for injury resulting from contact (e.g. , a blow to the head and a foul 
committed while a player is in a vulnerable position);  
e. The severity of any injury suffered by the offended player; and  
f. The outcome of the contact (e.g., whether it led to an altercation).
