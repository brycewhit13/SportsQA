Introduction
            

Description: Ultimate is a non-contact,
                    self-officiated disc sport played by two teams of seven
                    players. The object of the game is to score goals. A goal is
                    scored when a player catches any legal pass in the end zone
                    that player is attacking. A player may not run while holding
                    the disc. The disc is advanced by passing it to other
                    players. The disc may be passed in any direction. Any time a
                    pass is incomplete, a turnover occurs, resulting in an
                    immediate change of the team in possession of the disc.
                    Players are empowered to self-officiate using a framework
                    governed by the principles of Spirit of the Game.

Event Organizer Clause: The
                            event organizer
                            may modify rules relating to game logistics in order
                            to suit the event. Examples include game length
                            (game total), time limits (time caps), halftime
                            length, number of timeouts, starting time point
                            assessments, uniform requirements, and
                            observer
                            operations. Any such change must be established
                            before competition starts.
                        

Captain’s Clause: For games
                            not subject to the event organizer clause, a
                            game may be played under any variation of the rules
                            agreed upon by the
                            captains
                            of the teams involved. Otherwise, any rules

                            organizer.
                        



General vs. Specific Rules: Many of these
                    rules are general in nature and cover most situations.
                    However, some rules cover specific situations and override
                    the general case.

Spirit of the Game
            

Spirit of the Game is a set of principles
                    which places the responsibility for fair play on the player.
                    Highly competitive play is encouraged, but never at the
                    expense of mutual respect among competitors, adherence to
                    the agreed upon rules, or the basic joy of play.
                

All players are responsible for knowing,
                    administering, and adhering to the rules. The integrity of
                    ultimate depends on each player’s responsibility to
                    uphold the Spirit of the Game, and this responsibility
                    should remain paramount.
                

It is assumed that no player will
                    intentionally violate the rules; thus there are no harsh
                    penalties for inadvertent infractions, but rather a method
                    for resuming play in a manner that simulates what most
                    likely would have occurred absent the infraction. An
                    intentional infraction is cheating and considered a gross
                    offense against the Spirit of the Game. Players are morally
                    bound to abide by the rules and not gain advantage by
                    knowingly committing an infraction, or calling one where
                    none exists.
                    

If a player intentionally or
                            flagrantly violates the rules, the captains of each
                            team should discuss the incident and determine an
                            appropriate outcome, and are not bound by any
                            outcome dictated by these rules.
                        



Players should be mindful of the fact that
                    they are acting as officials in any arbitration between
                    teams. Players must:
                    
know the rules;
be fair-minded and objective;
be truthful;

explain their viewpoint clearly
                            and concisely;
                        

allow opponents a reasonable
                            chance to speak;
                        

consider their opponent’s
                            viewpoint;
                        

use respectful words and body
                            language;
                        

resolve disputes as quickly as
                            possible;
                        

make calls in a consistent manner
                            throughout the game; and
                        

only make a call where an
                            infraction is significant enough to make a
                            difference to the outcome of the action.
                        

[[Players are required to “explain their
                                viewpoint clearly and concisely” and “resolve
                                disputes as quickly as possible.” As such, most
                                discussions should not exceed thirty seconds
                                before either reaching a resolution or
                                requesting an observer to resolve the dispute.
                                If both players have had an opportunity to state
                                their viewpoint and it is clear that an
                                agreement will not be reached, players have an
                                obligation to accept that the call is contested
                                and resolve it as such. Where a dispute exists
                                regarding what a rule says, the players may
                                agree to consult a rulebook.]]




The following are examples of possible
                    actions to support good spirit:
                    

informing a teammate if they have
                            made a wrong or unnecessary call, caused a foul or
                            violation, or need a clarification of a rule;
                        

retracting a call when you no
                            longer believe the call was necessary or believe
                            that it was made in error and should not have been
                            called;
                        

complimenting an opponent for good
                            play or spirit;
                        

touching base with an opponent on
                            the sideline after a contentious interaction;
                        

discussing and/or making calls
                            about contact that could be considered a foul in
                            order to keep players safe;
                        

introducing yourself to your
                            opponent; and
                        

reacting calmly towards
                            disagreement or provocation.
                        



The following actions are clear violations
                    of the Spirit of the Game and must be avoided by all
                    participants:
                    

reckless play or dangerously
                            aggressive behavior;
                        

intentional fouling or other
                            intentional rule violations;
                        

taunting or intimidating opposing
                            players;
                        

disrespectful celebration after
                            scoring;
                        

making calls in retaliation to an
                            opponent’s calls or other actions;
                        

calling for a pass from an
                            opponent; and
                        

other win-at-all-costs behavior.
                        



Teams are guardians of the Spirit of the
                    Game, and must:
                    

take responsibility for teaching
                            their players the rules and good spirit;
                        

discipline
                            team members
                            who display poor spirit;
                        

provide constructive feedback to
                            other teams about what they are doing well and/or
                            how to improve their adherence to the Spirit of the
                            Game; and
                        

be aware regarding the potential
                            for implicit biases to impact play and Spirit of the
                            Game.
                            

Players and team leaders
                                    should acknowledge and recognize that the
                                    implementation of Spirit of the Game (SOTG)
                                    is susceptible to bias. Team leaders should
                                    be mindful of and encourage their teammates
                                    to be mindful of their own biases when
                                    considering and discussing interactions
                                    with, and impressions of, other teams as
                                    well as their own team. Understand that
                                    intent and impact are not the same. The
                                    intent of a person’s statement or gesture
                                    may be neutral or positive to them, but the
                                    impact of what they say or do may be harmful
                                    or hurtful to others.
                                





In the case where a novice player commits an
                    infraction out of ignorance of the rules, experienced
                    players are obliged to explain the infraction and clarify
                    what should happen.
                    

Coaches
                            should teach players to come to a resolution on
                            their own. If asked during a dispute
                            coaches
                            may offer rules clarifications.
                            Coaches
                            may not make calls from the sideline nor offer their
                            opinion on a play. After a dispute, and when the
                            player is not playing, a
                            coach
                            may talk to their own player about the dispute and
                            offer opinions and guidance.
                        



Rules should be interpreted by the players
                    directly involved in the play, or by players who had the
                    best perspective
                    on the play (3.A). Players may seek the
                    perspective of

                    appropriate call.
                

Players are responsible for making all calls
                    except where specific rules designate
                    non-players
                    to make calls.
                    [[For example, offsides on the
                        pull
                        or when

If after discussion players cannot agree, or
                    it is unclear:
                    
what occurred in a play, or

what would most likely have
                            occurred in a play,
                        


                    the disc is returned to the thrower.
                


Spirit of the Game is a set of principles
                    which places the responsibility for fair play on the player.
                    Highly competitive play is encouraged, but never at the
                    expense of mutual respect among competitors, adherence to
                    the agreed upon rules, or the basic joy of play.
                
All players are responsible for knowing,
                    administering, and adhering to the rules. The integrity of
                    ultimate depends on each player’s responsibility to
                    uphold the Spirit of the Game, and this responsibility
                    should remain paramount.
                
It is assumed that no player will
                    intentionally violate the rules; thus there are no harsh
                    penalties for inadvertent infractions, but rather a method
                    for resuming play in a manner that simulates what most
                    likely would have occurred absent the infraction. An
                    intentional infraction is cheating and considered a gross
                    offense against the Spirit of the Game. Players are morally
                    bound to abide by the rules and not gain advantage by
                    knowingly committing an infraction, or calling one where
                    none exists.
                    

If a player intentionally or
                            flagrantly violates the rules, the captains of each
                            team should discuss the incident and determine an
                            appropriate outcome, and are not bound by any
                            outcome dictated by these rules.

Players should be mindful of the fact that
                    they are acting as officials in any arbitration between
                    teams. Players must:
                    
know the rules;
be fair-minded and objective;
be truthful;

explain their viewpoint clearly
                            and concisely;
                        

allow opponents a reasonable
                            chance to speak;
                        

consider their opponent’s
                            viewpoint;
                        

use respectful words and body
                            language;
                        

resolve disputes as quickly as
                            possible;
                        

make calls in a consistent manner
                            throughout the game; and
                        

only make a call where an
                            infraction is significant enough to make a
                            difference to the outcome of the action.
                        

[[Players are required to “explain their
                                viewpoint clearly and concisely” and “resolve

                                    considering and discussing interactions
                                    with, and impressions of, other teams as
                                    well as their own team. Understand that
                                    intent and impact are not the same. The
                                    intent of a person’s statement or gesture
                                    may be neutral or positive to them, but the
                                    impact of what they say or do may be harmful
                                    or hurtful to others.
                                
In the case where a novice player commits an
                    infraction out of ignorance of the rules, experienced
                    players are obliged to explain the infraction and clarify
                    what should happen.
                    

Coaches
                            should teach players to come to a resolution on
                            their own. If asked during a dispute
                            coaches
                            may offer rules clarifications.
                            Coaches
                            may not make calls from the sideline nor offer their
                            opinion on a play. After a dispute, and when the
                            player is not playing, a
                            coach
                            may talk to their own player about the dispute and
                            offer opinions and guidance.

Rules should be interpreted by the players
                    directly involved in the play, or by players who had the
                    best perspective
                    on the play (3.A). Players may seek the
                    perspective of
                    sideline players
                    to clarify the rules, and to assist in making the
                    appropriate call.
                
Players are responsible for making all calls
                    except where specific rules designate
                    non-players
                    to make calls.

If after discussion players cannot agree, or

what occurred in a play, or

Definitions
            

Best perspective: The most complete view
                    available by a player that includes the relative positions
                    of the disc, ground, players, and line markers involved in a
                    play. On an unlined field, this may require sighting from
                    one field marker to another. Best perspective always belongs
                    to a player. However, players may rely on the following
                    sources as a component of best perspective:
                    

Players may seek the perspective
                            of
                            sideline players
                            to clarify the rules and to assist players in making
                            the appropriate call. Players may seek the
                            perspective of
                            coaches
                            to clarify a rule, but not to assist in making the
                            appropriate call.
                            

Sideline players
                                    should not offer their perspective unless
                                    solicited by a player. However, a
                                    sideline player
                                    may offer perspective without being asked by
                                    a player if the perspective offered is to
                                    the detriment of the
                                    sideline player’s
                                    team.
                                



Players may review
                            officially-designated video footage to assist in
                            resolving a call where such footage is available.
                            However, play may not be delayed to review video
                            footage.
                            [[For example, live instant replay in a stadium
                                setting may be used by players to resolve a
                                contested foul call. Players may not, however,
                                request that a particular play be replayed on
                                the screen. If, after reviewing the video,
                                players still cannot agree, they should not
                                delay the game to rewatch the play multiple
                                times; instead, the play should be treated as a
                                regular contested foul.]]



                    If no player has sufficient perspective to make a call, the
                    disc should revert to the thrower (in the case of
                    in-bounds/out-of-bounds and up/down disputes) or remain with
                    the receiver on the end zone line (in the case of
                    goal/non-goal disputes).
                

Completed pass: Any catch that results in
                    the team in possession of the disc retaining possession. Any
                    pass that is not complete is incomplete.
                

Foul: Non-Incidental contact between
                    opposing players (see 3.F for a
                    definition of incidental contact). In general, the player
                    initiating the contact has committed the foul.
                

Ground contact: All player contact with the
                    ground directly related to a specific event or maneuver
                    (e.g., jumping, diving, leaning or falling), including
                    landing or recovering after being off-balance. Items on the
                    ground are considered part of the ground.
                

Guarding: A defender is guarding an
                    offensive player
                    when they are within 10 feet of that offensive player and
                    are reacting to that
                    offensive player.
                    [[A defender who turns away from an
                        offensive player
                        and begins focusing on and reacting to the thrower is no
                        longer guarding that
                        offensive player.]]


Incidental contact: Contact between opposing
                    players that does not affect continued play.
                    [[For example, contact affects continued play if the
                        contact knocks a player off-balance and interferes with
                        their ability to continue cutting or playing
                        defense.]]


Legal position: A position established by a
                    marker
                    that does not violate any of the provisions outlined in
                    15.B.
                    [[This refers to legal marking position. In general,
                        this means there is sufficient space between the
                        marker
                        and the thrower’s torso, the marker is not
                        straddling the pivot, and the
                        marker’s
                        arms are not “wrapping” the thrower.]]


Line: A boundary defining the playing areas.
                    On an unlined field, the boundary is an imaginary line
                    segment between two field markers with the thickness of said
                    markers. Line segments are not extrapolated beyond the
                    defining markers.
                

Pivot: The particular part of the body in
                    continuous contact with a single spot on the field during a
                    thrower’s possession once the thrower has come to a
                    stop or has attempted a throw or fake. When there is a
                    definitive spot for putting the disc into play, the part of
                    the body in contact with that spot is the pivot.
                    [[This is not a body part, but rather an
                        infinitesimally small point on the body.]]


Possession of the disc: Sustained contact
                    with, and control of, a non-spinning disc.
                    

Catching a pass is equivalent to
                            establishing possession of that pass.
                        

If a player loses possession of a
                            disc during movement related to a catch, the initial
                            possession ends.
                            [[A disc that touches the ground while in a
                                player’s possession is not a turnover.]]


A disc in a player’s
                            possession is considered part of that player.
                            [[Thus, hitting the disc in a player’s
                                possession is a foul]]


The team whose player is in
                            possession, or whose players may pick up the disc,
                            is considered the team in possession. If the disc is
                            in the air following a legal pass, the
                            thrower’s team is considered the team in
                            possession.
                        



Pull: The throw from one team to the other
                    that starts play at the beginning of a half or after a goal.
                    It is not a legal pass for scoring and has many special
                    provisions (Section 9.B). The player on
                    the pulling team who possesses the disc and signals
                    readiness is the puller.
                    [[The pulling team may designate a new puller at any
                        time before the pull.]]


Scoring attempt: A scoring attempt starts at
                    the beginning of the game or when the previous goal is
                    scored and ends when the next goal is scored.
                

State of the disc: The nature of play at a
                    particular moment during the game. There are three states of
                    the disc:
                    

A disc is “in play”
                            when players are allowed to move and play may
                            proceed without the defense’s acknowledgment.
                            An in-bounds disc in the central zone is in play.
                            The disc is subject to a turnover. If no player has
                            possession
                            of a disc in play, any
                            offensive player
                            may become the thrower by taking
                            possession
                            of the disc (14.A). Once a
                            player has
                            possession
                            of the disc, they must establish a pivot at the spot
                            of the disc 14.A.2) prior to
                            attempting a pass (17.K).
                        

A disc is “live” when
                            players are allowed to move and the disc is subject
                            to a turnover, but the thrower cannot make a legal
                            pass (e.g., walking the disc to the spot where it is
                            to be put into play). For a live disc to be put into
                            play, the thrower must (1) establish a pivot at the
                            appropriate spot on the field, and (2) touch the
                            disc to the ground (14.B).
                        

A disc is “dead” when
                            play has stopped and can continue only with a check
                            (see 9.D). The disc is not subject to a turnover. A
                            dead disc may change states to either
                            live
                            or
                            in play
                            after a check depending on the circumstances.
                        



Stoppage of play: Any halting of play due to
                    a call, discussion, or timeout that requires a check or
                    self-check to restart play. The term play stops means a
                    stoppage of play occurs.
                    [[Play-halting calls include “foul,”
                        “violation,” “pick,”
                        “stall,” etc.]]


Throw: A disc in flight following any
                    throwing motion (including a fake) that results in the
                    thrower losing contact with the disc.
                    [[Generally, a non-spinning, falling disc is not
                        “in flight” unless it is intentionally
                        dropped.]]


A pass is equivalent to a throw.
                        

An intentionally dropped disc is
                            considered a thrown disc.
                        

The act of throwing is the motion
                            that transfers momentum from the thrower to the disc
                            in the direction of flight and results in a throw.
                            Pivots and wind-ups are not part of the act of
                            throwing.
                        

A throw is only considered
                            complete when an
                            offensive player
                            gains
                            possession
                            that is not otherwise negated.

                            the thrower if no pivot has been established. If the
                            disc is not in a player’s possession, a

                            in implementing a safe, fair, and efficient game.
                            Observers carefully watch the action of the game,
                            assist with communication, help uphold
                            self-officiating and the Spirit of the Game, assist

Sideline player: Any
                            team member

                            participate in the game, but who is not a player

                            coaches, and game or event officials. If no spirit captain
                            is designated, this role is assigned to the
                            captain(s).
                        

Team member: Any person
                            designated by the team, to the event organizer, to
                            be officially associated with the team, per the
                            rules established by the

                            team member

                            support purpose. Team support staff are generally
                            permitted in areas where
                            sideline players
                            are allowed, but may be further restricted by event
                            rules.
                        




Best perspective: The most complete view
                    available by a player that includes the relative positions
                    of the disc, ground, players, and line markers involved in a
                    play. On an unlined field, this may require sighting from
                    one field marker to another. Best perspective always belongs
                    to a player. However, players may rely on the following
                    sources as a component of best perspective:
                    

Players may seek the perspective
                            of
                            sideline players
                            to clarify the rules and to assist players in making
                            the appropriate call. Players may seek the
                            perspective of
                            coaches
                            to clarify a rule, but not to assist in making the
                            appropriate call.
                            

Sideline players
                                    should not offer their perspective unless
                                    solicited by a player. However, a
                                    sideline player
                                    may offer perspective without being asked by
                                    a player if the perspective offered is to
                                    the detriment of the
                                    sideline player’s
                                    team.
                                



Players may review
                            officially-designated video footage to assist in
                            resolving a call where such footage is available.
                            However, play may not be delayed to review video
                            footage.
                            [[For example, live instant replay in a stadium

                                contested foul call. Players may not, however,
                                request that a particular play be replayed on
                                the screen. If, after reviewing the video,
                                players still cannot agree, they should not
                                delay the game to rewatch the play multiple
                                times; instead, the play should be treated as a
                                regular contested foul.]]



                    If no player has sufficient perspective to make a call, the
                    disc should revert to the thrower (in the case of
                    in-bounds/out-of-bounds and up/down disputes) or remain with
                    the receiver on the end zone line (in the case of
                    goal/non-goal disputes).
                
Players may seek the perspective
                            of
                            sideline players
                            to clarify the rules and to assist players in making

Completed pass: Any catch that results in
                    the team in possession of the disc retaining possession. Any
                    pass that is not complete is incomplete.
                
Foul: Non-Incidental contact between
                    opposing players (see 3.F for a
                    definition of incidental contact). In general, the player
                    initiating the contact has committed the foul.
                
Ground contact: All player contact with the
                    ground directly related to a specific event or maneuver
                    (e.g., jumping, diving, leaning or falling), including
                    landing or recovering after being off-balance. Items on the
                    ground are considered part of the ground.
                
Guarding: A defender is guarding an
                    offensive player
                    when they are within 10 feet of that offensive player and
                    are reacting to that

Incidental contact: Contact between opposing
                    players that does not affect continued play.
                    [[For example, contact affects continued play if the

                        this means there is sufficient space between the
                        marker
                        and the thrower’s torso, the marker is not
                        straddling the pivot, and the
                        marker’s
                        arms are not “wrapping” the thrower.]]

Line: A boundary defining the playing areas.
                    On an unlined field, the boundary is an imaginary line
                    segment between two field markers with the thickness of said
                    markers. Line segments are not extrapolated beyond the
                    defining markers.
                
Pivot: The particular part of the body in
                    continuous contact with a single spot on the field during a
                    thrower’s possession once the thrower has come to a
                    stop or has attempted a throw or fake. When there is a
                    definitive spot for putting the disc into play, the part of
                    the body in contact with that spot is the pivot.
                    [[This is not a body part, but rather an
                        infinitesimally small point on the body.]]

Possession of the disc: Sustained contact
                    with, and control of, a non-spinning disc.
                    

Catching a pass is equivalent to
                            establishing possession of that pass.
                        

If a player loses possession of a
                            disc during movement related to a catch, the initial
                            possession ends.
                            [[A disc that touches the ground while in a
                                player’s possession is not a turnover.]]


A disc in a player’s
                            possession is considered part of that player.
                            [[Thus, hitting the disc in a player’s
                                possession is a foul]]


The team whose player is in
                            possession, or whose players may pick up the disc,
                            is considered the team in possession. If the disc is
                            in the air following a legal pass, the
                            thrower’s team is considered the team in
                            possession.

                            possession.
                        
Pull: The throw from one team to the other
                    that starts play at the beginning of a half or after a goal.
                    It is not a legal pass for scoring and has many special
                    provisions (Section 9.B). The player on
                    the pulling team who possesses the disc and signals
                    readiness is the puller.
                    [[The pulling team may designate a new puller at any
                        time before the pull.]]

Scoring attempt: A scoring attempt starts at
                    the beginning of the game or when the previous goal is
                    scored and ends when the next goal is scored.
                
State of the disc: The nature of play at a
                    particular moment during the game. There are three states of
                    the disc:
                    

A disc is “in play”
                            when players are allowed to move and play may
                            proceed without the defense’s acknowledgment.
                            An in-bounds disc in the central zone is in play.
                            The disc is subject to a turnover. If no player has
                            possession
                            of a disc in play, any
                            offensive player
                            may become the thrower by taking
                            possession
                            of the disc (14.A). Once a
                            player has
                            possession
                            of the disc, they must establish a pivot at the spot
                            of the disc 14.A.2) prior to
                            attempting a pass (17.K).
                        

A disc is “live” when
                            players are allowed to move and the disc is subject
                            to a turnover, but the thrower cannot make a legal
                            pass (e.g., walking the disc to the spot where it is
                            to be put into play). For a live disc to be put into
                            play, the thrower must (1) establish a pivot at the
                            appropriate spot on the field, and (2) touch the
                            disc to the ground (14.B).
                        

A disc is “dead” when
                            play has stopped and can continue only with a check
                            (see 9.D). The disc is not subject to a turnover. A
                            dead disc may change states to either
                            live
                            or
                            in play
                            after a check depending on the circumstances.

                            The disc is subject to a turnover. If no player has
                            possession
                            of a disc in play, any
                            offensive player
                            may become the thrower by taking
                            possession
                            of the disc (14.A). Once a
                            player has

                            after a check depending on the circumstances.
                        
Stoppage of play: Any halting of play due to
                    a call, discussion, or timeout that requires a check or
                    self-check to restart play. The term play stops means a
                    stoppage of play occurs.
                    [[Play-halting calls include “foul,”
                        “violation,” “pick,”
                        “stall,” etc.]]

Throw: A disc in flight following any
                    throwing motion (including a fake) that results in the
                    thrower losing contact with the disc.
                    [[Generally, a non-spinning, falling disc is not
                        “in flight” unless it is intentionally
                        dropped.]]


A pass is equivalent to a throw.
                        

An intentionally dropped disc is
                            considered a thrown disc.
                        

The act of throwing is the motion
                            that transfers momentum from the thrower to the disc
                            in the direction of flight and results in a throw.
                            Pivots and wind-ups are not part of the act of
                            throwing.
                        

A throw is only considered
                            complete when an
                            offensive player
                            gains
                            possession

Playing Field
            

The playing field is a rectangular area and
                    should be essentially flat, free of obstructions and afford
                    reasonable player safety. Well trimmed grass is the
                    recommended surface and all
                    lines should be marked.
                

The standard field of play has dimensions as
                    shown on the accompanying diagram (see
                    Appendix A).
                

The playing field is bounded by four
                    perimeter
                    lines: two (2) sidelines along the length and two (2) backlines
                    along the width. The perimeter lines are not part of the
                    playing field.
                

The playing field also includes two (2) goal
                    lines parallel to the backlines. The two (2) areas bounded
                    by each backline, the sidelines, and the nearest goal line
                    are the end zones.
                

The central zone is the playing field
                    excluding the end zones.
                    [[Central zone was previously referred to as the
                        playing field proper in previous editions of the
                        rules.]]


The goal lines separate the central zone
                    from the end zones and are part of the central zone.
                

Brick marks are located in the central zone
                    a set distance from each goal line and midway between the
                    sidelines. Reverse brick marks are located in each end zone
                    midway between the goal line and backline and midway between
                    the sidelines. A midfield mark is located midway between the
                    goal lines and midway between the sidelines.
                

The corners of the central zone and the end
                    zones are marked by brightly colored, flexible cones or
                    pylons.
                

It is recommended that the following
                    additional
                    lines are also established.
                    

The equipment line surrounds the
                            playing field. Spectators and gear should remain
                            behind this line to keep the perimeter safe and
                            clear during play.
                        

The team lines are outside of the
                            playing field, parallel to the sidelines.
                            Competitors and
                            coaches
                            should remain behind these lines to allow play
                            adjacent to the playing field.
                        



If play is obstructed by competitors,
                    coaches, spectators, or objects within five yards of the playing
                    field, any obstructed player or the thrower in
                    possession
                    of the disc may call this violation. Play resumes at the
                    stall count reached plus one, or 9 if over 8.

                    along the width. The perimeter lines are not part of the
                    playing field.
                
The playing field also includes two (2) goal
                    lines parallel to the backlines. The two (2) areas bounded
                    by each backline, the sidelines, and the nearest goal line
                    are the end zones.
                
The central zone is the playing field
                    excluding the end zones.

The goal lines separate the central zone
                    from the end zones and are part of the central zone.
                
Brick marks are located in the central zone
                    a set distance from each goal line and midway between the
                    sidelines. Reverse brick marks are located in each end zone
                    midway between the goal line and backline and midway between
                    the sidelines. A midfield mark is located midway between the
                    goal lines and midway between the sidelines.
                
The corners of the central zone and the end
                    zones are marked by brightly colored, flexible cones or

                            playing field. Spectators and gear should remain
                            behind this line to keep the perimeter safe and
                            clear during play.
                        

The team lines are outside of the
                            playing field, parallel to the sidelines.

Equipment
            

Any disc acceptable to both team
                    captains
                    may be used. If they cannot agree, the current Official Disc
                    of USA Ultimate is used.
                

Players may wear any soft clothing that does
                    not endanger the safety of other players or provide unfair
                    advantage.
                

Cleats with dangerous parts, such as
                    metallic baseball cleats, track spikes, or worn or broken
                    studs with sharp edges, are not allowed.
                

Each player must wear a uniform or other
                    clothing distinguishing that player from players on the
                    other team. In tournament play, matching uniforms and
                    numbered jerseys are recommended.
                

Players may not use clothing or equipment to
                    unfairly inhibit or assist the movement of the disc or
                    another player.

Length of Game
            

The game total is the predetermined number
                    of goals to win the game. A game is played until one team
                    first reaches the game total.
                    

A standard game has a game total
                            of 15.
                        



The halftime target is the number of goals
                    necessary to first reach at least half of the game total.
                    Halftime begins when one team’s score first reaches
                    the halftime target.
                    [[In a game with a game total of 15, the halftime
                        target will be 8.]]


A standard halftime is 10 minutes.

                                the defense will have 15 seconds to release the

Timeouts
            

A timeout stops play and suspends time limit
                    counts.
                

Team Timeout: Each team has two team
                    timeouts per half in a standard game.
                    

A team timeout lasts 70 seconds.
                        

Any player may call a timeout
                            after a goal is scored and before both teams have
                            signaled readiness to start play. Time limit counts
                            between points are suspended for 70 seconds. A
                            timeout may not be called between a re-pull call and
                            the ensuing
                            pull.
                        

After the
                            pull, only a thrower with
                            possession
                            of the disc that has survived
                            ground contact
                            can call a timeout. The player must form a T with
                            one hand and the disc, and should audibly say
                            “timeout.” The timeout begins when the T
                            is formed. The disc is then placed on the ground at
                            the pivot spot.
                        

Restarting play after a timeout
                            called by a thrower:
                            

All players at the time
                                    of the timeout call must return to play
                                    unless an injury timeout also is called.
                                

Each
                                    offensive player
                                    must establish a stationary position by the
                                    end of the timeout. Movement after this time
                                    and before the disc is checked into play is
                                    a violation. The defense has ninety seconds
                                    after the beginning of the timeout or up to
                                    twenty seconds after all
                                    offensive players
                                    have established their positions (whichever
                                    is longer) to check the disc into play.
                                

The player who had
                                    possession
                                    of the disc when the team timeout was called
                                    restarts play with a check at the pivot
                                    spot, and the
                                    marker
                                    resumes the stall count with the word
                                    “stalling” followed by the last
                                    number uttered before the timeout plus one
                                    or 9 if over 8, however
                                    15.A.4 applies.
                                

If the time limits for
                                    the timeout are exceeded by one team, a
                                    player on the other team may announce
                                    “delay of game” and the player
                                    at the location the disc is to be put into
                                    play may self-check the disc into play
                                    without acknowledgment by the opposing team.
                                    In order to invoke this rule a player must
                                    give warnings of 20, 10, and 5 seconds.
                                



If the disc is live or
                            in play
                            and the thrower attempts to call a timeout when the
                            team in possession has no timeouts remaining, play
                            is stopped. The
                            marker
                            resumes the stall count with the number last uttered
                            before the call plus three (e.g. if the timeout was
                            called after a stall count of two, play would resume
                            on a stall count of five). If this results in a
                            stall count of ten or above, this is a turnover.
                        



Injury Timeout: A timeout called for a
                    player injury. During an injury timeout, the health and
                    safety of the injured player are of primary concern.
                    

Any player on the injured
                            player’s team may call an injury timeout.
                        

The timeout is retroactive to the
                            time of the injury, unless the injured player
                            chooses to continue play before the timeout is
                            called, in which case, the timeout begins at the
                            time of the call. If the disc is in the air or the
                            thrower is in the act of throwing at the time of the
                            injury or of the call when the player has continued
                            play, the timeout begins when the play is completed.
                        

Restarting play after an injury
                            timeout:
                            

If a player in
                                    possession
                                    leaves the field following an injury, the
                                    replacing player takes
                                    possession.
                                

Play restarts at the
                                    appropriate spot with a check and the
                                    marker
                                    resumes any stall count with the word
                                    stalling followed by the last number uttered
                                    before the injury timeout started plus one
                                    or 9 if over 8. The substitution of the
                                    thrower or
                                    marker
                                    does not alter the stall count.
                                

All players must resume
                                    their locations on the field at the time the
                                    injury timeout began (i.e., players may not
                                    set up), unless a team timeout is also
                                    called.
                                



If the injured player does not
                            leave the game after an injury timeout, that
                            player’s team is charged with a team timeout
                            unless the injury was caused by an opposing player.
                            If the team being charged with the timeout is also
                            the team in possession and has no timeouts
                            remaining, it is a turnover.
                        

If an injury timeout is called
                            during a team timeout, the opposing team must be
                            notified as soon as the injury is discovered (8.A.2).
                        

If an injury timeout is called
                            between points, all time limits are suspended until
                            the injured player is removed from the field.
                        

Any player,
                            coach, or
                            observer
                            should call an injury timeout for a player who is
                            bleeding or has an exposed open wound.
                            

This timeout takes
                                    effect when the call is made (i.e., is not
                                    retroactive to the time of injury). If the
                                    disc is in the air or the thrower is in the
                                    act of throwing at the time of the call, the
                                    timeout begins when the play is completed.
                                    However, the disc is returned to the thrower
                                    if avoiding potential contact with the
                                    bleeding player is determined to have
                                    affected the play.
                                

This timeout may last up
                                    to 70 seconds, during which time the injured
                                    player must have the wound effectively
                                    covered in order to return to the point in
                                    progress.
                                

If play cannot be
                                    restarted with the injured player’s
                                    wound effectively covered in 70 seconds, the
                                    player’s team may either
                                    

replace the
                                            injured player according to
                                            7.C.3, or
                                        

call a team
                                            timeout, if they have one, in order
                                            to extend the time frame to have the
                                            wound effectively covered and leave
                                            the player in the game.
                                        



A bleeding or exposed
                                    open wound is “effectively
                                    covered” if it is covered with a
                                    dressing sturdy enough to withstand the
                                    demands of activity and able to prevent
                                    bodily fluids from coming in contact with
                                    other players.
                                

Any player whose
                                    clothing has blood on it must have the
                                    affected areas disinfected or must change
                                    the clothing before returning to play.
                                

Whether a player may
                                    return to play is determined by appropriate
                                    medical staff. If medical staff is not
                                    available,
                                    captains
                                    and
                                    coaches
                                    may agree that a wound has been effectively
                                    covered and any clothing issues have been
                                    addressed.
                                





Technical Timeout: A technical timeout may
                    be called for illegal equipment, a dangerous condition, or a
                    broken disc.
                    

Any player recognizing a condition
                            that endangers themselves or other players may call
                            a technical timeout during play by calling
                            “technical.” The thrower may call a
                            technical timeout during play to replace a cracked,
                            torn, deeply gouged, creased, or punctured disc; a
                            warped, wet or dirty disc does not qualify. The
                            timeout begins at the time of the call. If the disc
                            is in the air or the act of throwing at the time of
                            the call, the timeout begins when the play is
                            completed.
                            

If a player discovers a
                                    dangerous condition after the disc is in the
                                    air or while the thrower is in the act of
                                    throwing and the player ceases play as a
                                    result, the disc is returned to the thrower
                                    regardless of the outcome of that pass.
                                    However, if both teams agree that ceasing
                                    play did not affect the outcome of the
                                    throw, the result of the play stands.
                                    [[For example, a receiver is not
                                        required to continue playing through a
                                        dangerous situation, such as a child
                                        wandering onto the field. In that case,
                                        the receiver should stop making a play
                                        on the disc in order to prioritize the
                                        safety of themselves and others, and the
                                        disc will be returned to the thrower
                                        once the dangerous situation is
                                        rectified.]]


If possession
                                            reverts to the thrower, all players
                                            return to the locations they
                                            occupied at the time of the throw
                                        





Any player may briefly extend a
                            stoppage of play
                            to correct faulty equipment (e.g., to tie shoelaces
                            or straighten a disc), but active play may not be
                            stopped for this purpose. (Note: play does not stop
                            during a turnover even if the disc is
                            out-of-bounds.)
                        

A player unable to correct illegal
                            equipment in a timely manner must be substituted in
                            accordance with 8.A.2.
                        

Restarting play after a technical
                            timeout:
                            

The thrower restarts
                                    play at the appropriate spot with a check
                                    and the
                                    marker
                                    resumes any stall count as follows:
                                    

If the
                                            technical timeout was called during
                                            a
                                            stoppage of play, the count resumes at the
                                            appropriate count for the event that
                                            stopped play.
                                        

If the
                                            technical timeout stopped play, the
                                            count resumes at the stall count
                                            reached plus one, or at six if over
                                            five.
                                        



If a player in
                                    possession leaves the field due to illegal
                                    equipment, the replacing player puts the
                                    disc into play. The substitution of the
                                    thrower or
                                    marker
                                    does not alter the stall count.
                                

All players must resume
                                    their locations on the field at the time the
                                    timeout began (i.e., players may not set
                                    up), unless a team timeout is also called.
                                





Spirit timeout: A spirit timeout may be
                    called by one or both teams’
                    spirit captain(s)
                    if they believe that either or both teams have failed to
                    follow the Spirit of the Game, and (1) game play has become
                    dangerous; or (2) repeated Spirit of the Game violations are
                    causing conflict between the teams. Spirit timeouts are
                    subject to the following provisions:
                    

A spirit timeout can be called
                            only if all of the following conditions have been
                            met:
                            

Both
                                    spirit captains
                                    have discussed the perceived Spirit of the
                                    Game violation(s) and adjustments to address
                                    those violations, and one or more members of
                                    either or both teams have not adjusted their
                                    conduct.
                                

Both
                                    spirit captains
                                    have discussed the need to call a spirit
                                    timeout before calling the spirit timeout.
                                    It is not required that both
                                    spirit captains
                                    agree that a spirit timeout is necessary.
                                
Play is stopped.

In games with
                                    observers, spirit timeouts initiated by the
                                    spirit captains
                                    must be communicated to the
                                    observers
                                    before being called.
                                    Observers
                                    may call a spirit timeout if the
                                    observer
                                    believes it is needed and at least one of
                                    the
                                    spirit captains
                                    agrees.
                                



During the spirit timeout:
                            

Both teams will aim to
                                    complete all discussions within 5 minutes,
                                    with a goal of resuming play as quickly as
                                    possible. If teams require more time to
                                    resolve spirit discussions, the timeout can
                                    be extended with the consent of both
                                    spirit captains.
                                

Team members
                                    may not engage in tactical discussions.
                                    Team member
                                    may not extend the spirit timeout to try to
                                    gain a tactical advantage.
                                

Spirit timeouts may
                                    follow one of two formats, as determined by
                                    the
                                    spirit captains. Where the
                                    spirit captains
                                    disagree as to the format of the spirit
                                    timeout, the default format is for teams to
                                    form one spirit circle.
                                    

All
                                            team members
                                            of both teams will form one spirit
                                            circle, alternating players from
                                            each team, if possible. The
                                            spirit captains
                                            will lead a conversation addressing
                                            and proposing solutions to resolve
                                            spirit issues; or
                                        

Two circles
                                            will be formed, one for each team to
                                            internally resolve spirit issues
                                            that have already been discussed
                                            between the
                                            spirit captains
                                            of the opposing team.
                                        





After the spirit timeout:
                            

The game resumes in the
                                    same manner as it does after a team timeout.
                                

Spirit timeouts do not
                                    affect timeouts available.
                                

For spirit timeouts
                                    lasting five minutes or less, the time taken
                                    for a spirit timeout will automatically be
                                    added to the length of the game time to
                                    determine time caps for the game. After the
                                    initial five minutes, although
                                    spirit captains
                                    may always agree to extend a spirit timeout,
                                    event organizers may limit the time that can
                                    be added to the length of games. The
                                    spirit captain(s)
                                    initiating the spirit timeout will convey
                                    the start and end of the stoppage to
                                    event support staff
                                    or the event organizer for time-keeping
                                    purposes.
                                





Injury, technical, and spirit timeouts are
                    meant to be used exclusively to address the issue for which
                    the timeout was called. Only personnel needed to address the
                    issue should be on the field and only for that purpose.
                    Teams may not use these timeouts as team timeouts, unless
                    they also call a team timeout.
                


A timeout stops play and suspends time limit
                    counts.
                
Team Timeout: Each team has two team
                    timeouts per half in a standard game.
                    

A team timeout lasts 70 seconds.
                        

Any player may call a timeout
                            after a goal is scored and before both teams have
                            signaled readiness to start play. Time limit counts
                            between points are suspended for 70 seconds. A
                            timeout may not be called between a re-pull call and
                            the ensuing
                            pull.
                        

After the
                            pull, only a thrower with
                            possession
                            of the disc that has survived
                            ground contact
                            can call a timeout. The player must form a T with
                            one hand and the disc, and should audibly say
                            “timeout.” The timeout begins when the T
                            is formed. The disc is then placed on the ground at
                            the pivot spot.
                        

Restarting play after a timeout
                            called by a thrower:
                            

All players at the time
                                    of the timeout call must return to play
                                    unless an injury timeout also is called.
                                

Each
                                    offensive player
                                    must establish a stationary position by the
                                    end of the timeout. Movement after this time
                                    and before the disc is checked into play is
                                    a violation. The defense has ninety seconds
                                    after the beginning of the timeout or up to
                                    twenty seconds after all
                                    offensive players
                                    have established their positions (whichever
                                    is longer) to check the disc into play.
                                

The player who had
                                    possession
                                    of the disc when the team timeout was called
                                    restarts play with a check at the pivot
                                    spot, and the
                                    marker
                                    resumes the stall count with the word
                                    “stalling” followed by the last
                                    number uttered before the timeout plus one
                                    or 9 if over 8, however
                                    15.A.4 applies.
                                

If the time limits for
                                    the timeout are exceeded by one team, a
                                    player on the other team may announce
                                    “delay of game” and the player
                                    at the location the disc is to be put into
                                    play may self-check the disc into play
                                    without acknowledgment by the opposing team.
                                    In order to invoke this rule a player must
                                    give warnings of 20, 10, and 5 seconds.
                                



If the disc is live or
                            in play
                            and the thrower attempts to call a timeout when the
                            team in possession has no timeouts remaining, play
                            is stopped. The
                            marker
                            resumes the stall count with the number last uttered
                            before the call plus three (e.g. if the timeout was
                            called after a stall count of two, play would resume
                            on a stall count of five). If this results in a
                            stall count of ten or above, this is a turnover.
                        


A team timeout lasts 70 seconds.
                        
Any player may call a timeout
                            after a goal is scored and before both teams have
                            signaled readiness to start play. Time limit counts
                            between points are suspended for 70 seconds. A
                            timeout may not be called between a re-pull call and
                            the ensuing
                            pull.
                        
After the
                            pull, only a thrower with
                            possession
                            of the disc that has survived
                            ground contact
                            can call a timeout. The player must form a T with
                            one hand and the disc, and should audibly say
                            “timeout.” The timeout begins when the T
                            is formed. The disc is then placed on the ground at
                            the pivot spot.
                        
Restarting play after a timeout
                            called by a thrower:
                            

All players at the time
                                    of the timeout call must return to play
                                    unless an injury timeout also is called.
                                

Each
                                    offensive player
                                    must establish a stationary position by the
                                    end of the timeout. Movement after this time
                                    and before the disc is checked into play is
                                    a violation. The defense has ninety seconds
                                    after the beginning of the timeout or up to
                                    twenty seconds after all
                                    offensive players
                                    have established their positions (whichever
                                    is longer) to check the disc into play.
                                

The player who had
                                    possession
                                    of the disc when the team timeout was called
                                    restarts play with a check at the pivot
                                    spot, and the
                                    marker
                                    resumes the stall count with the word
                                    “stalling” followed by the last
                                    number uttered before the timeout plus one
                                    or 9 if over 8, however
                                    15.A.4 applies.
                                

If the time limits for
                                    the timeout are exceeded by one team, a
                                    player on the other team may announce
                                    “delay of game” and the player
                                    at the location the disc is to be put into
                                    play may self-check the disc into play
                                    without acknowledgment by the opposing team.
                                    In order to invoke this rule a player must
                                    give warnings of 20, 10, and 5 seconds.
                                


All players at the time
                                    of the timeout call must return to play

                                    give warnings of 20, 10, and 5 seconds.
                                
If the disc is live or
                            in play
                            and the thrower attempts to call a timeout when the
                            team in possession has no timeouts remaining, play
                            is stopped. The
                            marker
                            resumes the stall count with the number last uttered
                            before the call plus three (e.g. if the timeout was
                            called after a stall count of two, play would resume
                            on a stall count of five). If this results in a
                            stall count of ten or above, this is a turnover.
                        
Injury Timeout: A timeout called for a
                    player injury. During an injury timeout, the health and
                    safety of the injured player are of primary concern.
                    

Any player on the injured
                            player’s team may call an injury timeout.
                        

The timeout is retroactive to the
                            time of the injury, unless the injured player
                            chooses to continue play before the timeout is
                            called, in which case, the timeout begins at the
                            time of the call. If the disc is in the air or the
                            thrower is in the act of throwing at the time of the
                            injury or of the call when the player has continued
                            play, the timeout begins when the play is completed.
                        

Restarting play after an injury
                            timeout:
                            

If a player in
                                    possession
                                    leaves the field following an injury, the
                                    replacing player takes
                                    possession.
                                

Play restarts at the
                                    appropriate spot with a check and the
                                    marker
                                    resumes any stall count with the word
                                    stalling followed by the last number uttered
                                    before the injury timeout started plus one
                                    or 9 if over 8. The substitution of the
                                    thrower or
                                    marker
                                    does not alter the stall count.
                                

All players must resume
                                    their locations on the field at the time the
                                    injury timeout began (i.e., players may not
                                    set up), unless a team timeout is also
                                    called.
                                



If the injured player does not
                            leave the game after an injury timeout, that
                            player’s team is charged with a team timeout
                            unless the injury was caused by an opposing player.
                            If the team being charged with the timeout is also
                            the team in possession and has no timeouts
                            remaining, it is a turnover.
                        

If an injury timeout is called
                            during a team timeout, the opposing team must be
                            notified as soon as the injury is discovered (8.A.2).
                        

If an injury timeout is called
                            between points, all time limits are suspended until
                            the injured player is removed from the field.
                        

Any player,
                            coach, or
                            observer
                            should call an injury timeout for a player who is
                            bleeding or has an exposed open wound.
                            

This timeout takes
                                    effect when the call is made (i.e., is not
                                    retroactive to the time of injury). If the
                                    disc is in the air or the thrower is in the
                                    act of throwing at the time of the call, the
                                    timeout begins when the play is completed.
                                    However, the disc is returned to the thrower
                                    if avoiding potential contact with the
                                    bleeding player is determined to have
                                    affected the play.
                                

This timeout may last up
                                    to 70 seconds, during which time the injured
                                    player must have the wound effectively
                                    covered in order to return to the point in
                                    progress.
                                

If play cannot be
                                    restarted with the injured player’s
                                    wound effectively covered in 70 seconds, the
                                    player’s team may either
                                    

replace the
                                            injured player according to
                                            7.C.3, or
                                        

call a team
                                            timeout, if they have one, in order
                                            to extend the time frame to have the
                                            wound effectively covered and leave
                                            the player in the game.
                                        



A bleeding or exposed
                                    open wound is “effectively
                                    covered” if it is covered with a
                                    dressing sturdy enough to withstand the
                                    demands of activity and able to prevent
                                    bodily fluids from coming in contact with
                                    other players.
                                

Any player whose
                                    clothing has blood on it must have the
                                    affected areas disinfected or must change
                                    the clothing before returning to play.
                                

Whether a player may
                                    return to play is determined by appropriate
                                    medical staff. If medical staff is not
                                    available,
                                    captains
                                    and
                                    coaches
                                    may agree that a wound has been effectively
                                    covered and any clothing issues have been
                                    addressed.
                                




Any player on the injured
                            player’s team may call an injury timeout.
                        
The timeout is retroactive to the
                            time of the injury, unless the injured player
                            chooses to continue play before the timeout is
                            called, in which case, the timeout begins at the
                            time of the call. If the disc is in the air or the
                            thrower is in the act of throwing at the time of the
                            injury or of the call when the player has continued
                            play, the timeout begins when the play is completed.

If a player in
                                    possession

All players must resume

                                    injury timeout began (i.e., players may not
                                    set up), unless a team timeout is also
                                    called.
                                


If a player in

                                    possession.
                                
Play restarts at the
                                    appropriate spot with a check and the
                                    marker

                                    injury timeout began (i.e., players may not

                                    called.
                                
If the injured player does not
                            leave the game after an injury timeout, that
                            player’s team is charged with a team timeout
                            unless the injury was caused by an opposing player.
                            If the team being charged with the timeout is also
                            the team in possession and has no timeouts
                            remaining, it is a turnover.
                        
If an injury timeout is called
                            during a team timeout, the opposing team must be
                            notified as soon as the injury is discovered (8.A.2).
                        
If an injury timeout is called
                            between points, all time limits are suspended until
                            the injured player is removed from the field.
                        
Any player,
                            coach, or
                            observer
                            should call an injury timeout for a player who is
                            bleeding or has an exposed open wound.
                            

This timeout takes
                                    effect when the call is made (i.e., is not
                                    retroactive to the time of injury). If the
                                    disc is in the air or the thrower is in the
                                    act of throwing at the time of the call, the
                                    timeout begins when the play is completed.
                                    However, the disc is returned to the thrower
                                    if avoiding potential contact with the
                                    bleeding player is determined to have
                                    affected the play.
                                

This timeout may last up
                                    to 70 seconds, during which time the injured
                                    player must have the wound effectively
                                    covered in order to return to the point in
                                    progress.
                                

If play cannot be
                                    restarted with the injured player’s
                                    wound effectively covered in 70 seconds, the
                                    player’s team may either

                                            7.C.3, or
                                        

call a team
                                            timeout, if they have one, in order
                                            to extend the time frame to have the
                                            wound effectively covered and leave
                                            the player in the game.
                                        



A bleeding or exposed
                                    open wound is “effectively
                                    covered” if it is covered with a
                                    dressing sturdy enough to withstand the
                                    demands of activity and able to prevent
                                    bodily fluids from coming in contact with
                                    other players.
                                

Any player whose
                                    clothing has blood on it must have the
                                    affected areas disinfected or must change
                                    the clothing before returning to play.
                                

Whether a player may
                                    return to play is determined by appropriate
                                    medical staff. If medical staff is not
                                    available,
                                    captains

                                    may agree that a wound has been effectively
                                    covered and any clothing issues have been
                                    addressed.

Whether a player may

Technical Timeout: A technical timeout may
                    be called for illegal equipment, a dangerous condition, or a
                    broken disc.
                    

Any player recognizing a condition
                            that endangers themselves or other players may call
                            a technical timeout during play by calling
                            “technical.” The thrower may call a
                            technical timeout during play to replace a cracked,
                            torn, deeply gouged, creased, or punctured disc; a
                            warped, wet or dirty disc does not qualify. The
                            timeout begins at the time of the call. If the disc
                            is in the air or the act of throwing at the time of
                            the call, the timeout begins when the play is
                            completed.
                            

If a player discovers a
                                    dangerous condition after the disc is in the
                                    air or while the thrower is in the act of
                                    throwing and the player ceases play as a
                                    result, the disc is returned to the thrower
                                    regardless of the outcome of that pass.
                                    However, if both teams agree that ceasing
                                    play did not affect the outcome of the
                                    throw, the result of the play stands.
                                    [[For example, a receiver is not
                                        required to continue playing through a
                                        dangerous situation, such as a child
                                        wandering onto the field. In that case,
                                        the receiver should stop making a play

                                        disc will be returned to the thrower
                                        once the dangerous situation is
                                        rectified.]]


If possession
                                            reverts to the thrower, all players
                                            return to the locations they
                                            occupied at the time of the throw
                                        





Any player may briefly extend a
                            stoppage of play
                            to correct faulty equipment (e.g., to tie shoelaces
                            or straighten a disc), but active play may not be
                            stopped for this purpose. (Note: play does not stop
                            during a turnover even if the disc is
                            out-of-bounds.)
                        

A player unable to correct illegal
                            equipment in a timely manner must be substituted in
                            accordance with 8.A.2.
                        

Restarting play after a technical
                            timeout:
                            

The thrower restarts
                                    play at the appropriate spot with a check
                                    and the
                                    marker
                                    resumes any stall count as follows:
                                    

If the
                                            technical timeout was called during
                                            a
                                            stoppage of play, the count resumes at the
                                            appropriate count for the event that
                                            stopped play.
                                        

If the
                                            technical timeout stopped play, the
                                            count resumes at the stall count
                                            reached plus one, or at six if over
                                            five.
                                        



If a player in
                                    possession leaves the field due to illegal
                                    equipment, the replacing player puts the
                                    disc into play. The substitution of the
                                    thrower or
                                    marker
                                    does not alter the stall count.
                                

All players must resume
                                    their locations on the field at the time the
                                    timeout began (i.e., players may not set
                                    up), unless a team timeout is also called.
                                




Any player recognizing a condition
                            that endangers themselves or other players may call
                            a technical timeout during play by calling
                            “technical.” The thrower may call a
                            technical timeout during play to replace a cracked,
                            torn, deeply gouged, creased, or punctured disc; a
                            warped, wet or dirty disc does not qualify. The
                            timeout begins at the time of the call. If the disc
                            is in the air or the act of throwing at the time of
                            the call, the timeout begins when the play is
                            completed.
                            

If a player discovers a
                                    dangerous condition after the disc is in the
                                    air or while the thrower is in the act of
                                    throwing and the player ceases play as a
                                    result, the disc is returned to the thrower
                                    regardless of the outcome of that pass.
                                    However, if both teams agree that ceasing
                                    play did not affect the outcome of the
                                    throw, the result of the play stands.

                                        wandering onto the field. In that case,
                                        the receiver should stop making a play
                                        on the disc in order to prioritize the
                                        safety of themselves and others, and the

                                            occupied at the time of the throw

                                    up), unless a team timeout is also called.
                                
Spirit timeout: A spirit timeout may be
                    called by one or both teams’
                    spirit captain(s)
                    if they believe that either or both teams have failed to
                    follow the Spirit of the Game, and (1) game play has become
                    dangerous; or (2) repeated Spirit of the Game violations are
                    causing conflict between the teams. Spirit timeouts are
                    subject to the following provisions:
                    

A spirit timeout can be called
                            only if all of the following conditions have been
                            met:
                            

Both
                                    spirit captains
                                    have discussed the perceived Spirit of the
                                    Game violation(s) and adjustments to address
                                    those violations, and one or more members of
                                    either or both teams have not adjusted their
                                    conduct.
                                

Both
                                    spirit captains
                                    have discussed the need to call a spirit
                                    timeout before calling the spirit timeout.
                                    It is not required that both
                                    spirit captains
                                    agree that a spirit timeout is necessary.
                                
Play is stopped.

In games with
                                    observers, spirit timeouts initiated by the
                                    spirit captains
                                    must be communicated to the
                                    observers
                                    before being called.
                                    Observers
                                    may call a spirit timeout if the
                                    observer
                                    believes it is needed and at least one of
                                    the
                                    spirit captains
                                    agrees.
                                



During the spirit timeout:
                            

Both teams will aim to
                                    complete all discussions within 5 minutes,
                                    with a goal of resuming play as quickly as
                                    possible. If teams require more time to
                                    resolve spirit discussions, the timeout can
                                    be extended with the consent of both
                                    spirit captains.
                                

Team members
                                    may not engage in tactical discussions.
                                    Team member
                                    may not extend the spirit timeout to try to
                                    gain a tactical advantage.
                                

Spirit timeouts may
                                    follow one of two formats, as determined by
                                    the
                                    spirit captains. Where the
                                    spirit captains
                                    disagree as to the format of the spirit
                                    timeout, the default format is for teams to
                                    form one spirit circle.
                                    

All
                                            team members
                                            of both teams will form one spirit
                                            circle, alternating players from
                                            each team, if possible. The
                                            spirit captains
                                            will lead a conversation addressing
                                            and proposing solutions to resolve
                                            spirit issues; or
                                        

Two circles
                                            will be formed, one for each team to
                                            internally resolve spirit issues
                                            that have already been discussed
                                            between the
                                            spirit captains
                                            of the opposing team.
                                        





After the spirit timeout:
                            

The game resumes in the
                                    same manner as it does after a team timeout.
                                

Spirit timeouts do not
                                    affect timeouts available.
                                

For spirit timeouts
                                    lasting five minutes or less, the time taken
                                    for a spirit timeout will automatically be
                                    added to the length of the game time to
                                    determine time caps for the game. After the
                                    initial five minutes, although
                                    spirit captains
                                    may always agree to extend a spirit timeout,
                                    event organizers may limit the time that can
                                    be added to the length of games. The
                                    spirit captain(s)
                                    initiating the spirit timeout will convey
                                    the start and end of the stoppage to
                                    event support staff
                                    or the event organizer for time-keeping
                                    purposes.
                                




A spirit timeout can be called
                            only if all of the following conditions have been
                            met:
                            

Both
                                    spirit captains
                                    have discussed the perceived Spirit of the
                                    Game violation(s) and adjustments to address
                                    those violations, and one or more members of
                                    either or both teams have not adjusted their
                                    conduct.
                                

Both
                                    spirit captains
                                    have discussed the need to call a spirit
                                    timeout before calling the spirit timeout.
                                    It is not required that both
                                    spirit captains
                                    agree that a spirit timeout is necessary.
                                
Play is stopped.

In games with
                                    observers, spirit timeouts initiated by the
                                    spirit captains
                                    must be communicated to the
                                    observers
                                    before being called.
                                    Observers
                                    may call a spirit timeout if the
                                    observer
                                    believes it is needed and at least one of
                                    the
                                    spirit captains
                                    agrees.
                                


Both
                                    spirit captains
                                    have discussed the perceived Spirit of the
                                    Game violation(s) and adjustments to address
                                    those violations, and one or more members of
                                    either or both teams have not adjusted their
                                    conduct.
                                
Both
                                    spirit captains
                                    have discussed the need to call a spirit
                                    timeout before calling the spirit timeout.
                                    It is not required that both
                                    spirit captains
                                    agree that a spirit timeout is necessary.
                                Play is stopped.
In games with
                                    observers, spirit timeouts initiated by the
                                    spirit captains
                                    must be communicated to the
                                    observers
                                    before being called.
                                    Observers
                                    may call a spirit timeout if the
                                    observer
                                    believes it is needed and at least one of
                                    the
                                    spirit captains
                                    agrees.
                                
During the spirit timeout:
                            

Both teams will aim to
                                    complete all discussions within 5 minutes,
                                    with a goal of resuming play as quickly as
                                    possible. If teams require more time to
                                    resolve spirit discussions, the timeout can
                                    be extended with the consent of both
                                    spirit captains.
                                

Team members
                                    may not engage in tactical discussions.
                                    Team member
                                    may not extend the spirit timeout to try to
                                    gain a tactical advantage.
                                

Spirit timeouts may
                                    follow one of two formats, as determined by
                                    the
                                    spirit captains. Where the
                                    spirit captains
                                    disagree as to the format of the spirit
                                    timeout, the default format is for teams to
                                    form one spirit circle.
                                    

All
                                            team members
                                            of both teams will form one spirit
                                            circle, alternating players from
                                            each team, if possible. The
                                            spirit captains
                                            will lead a conversation addressing
                                            and proposing solutions to resolve
                                            spirit issues; or
                                        

Two circles
                                            will be formed, one for each team to
                                            internally resolve spirit issues
                                            that have already been discussed
                                            between the
                                            spirit captains
                                            of the opposing team.
                                        




Both teams will aim to
                                    complete all discussions within 5 minutes,
                                    with a goal of resuming play as quickly as
                                    possible. If teams require more time to
                                    resolve spirit discussions, the timeout can
                                    be extended with the consent of both
                                    spirit captains.
                                
Team members
                                    may not engage in tactical discussions.

                                    may not extend the spirit timeout to try to
                                    gain a tactical advantage.
                                
Spirit timeouts may
                                    follow one of two formats, as determined by
                                    the
                                    spirit captains. Where the
                                    spirit captains
                                    disagree as to the format of the spirit
                                    timeout, the default format is for teams to
                                    form one spirit circle.
                                    

All
                                            team members
                                            of both teams will form one spirit
                                            circle, alternating players from
                                            each team, if possible. The
                                            spirit captains
                                            will lead a conversation addressing
                                            and proposing solutions to resolve
                                            spirit issues; or
                                        

Two circles
                                            will be formed, one for each team to
                                            internally resolve spirit issues
                                            that have already been discussed
                                            between the
                                            spirit captains
                                            of the opposing team.
                                        


All
                                            team members
                                            of both teams will form one spirit
                                            circle, alternating players from
                                            each team, if possible. The
                                            spirit captains
                                            will lead a conversation addressing
                                            and proposing solutions to resolve
                                            spirit issues; or
                                        
Two circles
                                            will be formed, one for each team to
                                            internally resolve spirit issues
                                            that have already been discussed
                                            between the
                                            spirit captains
                                            of the opposing team.
                                        
After the spirit timeout:
                            

The game resumes in the
                                    same manner as it does after a team timeout.
                                

Spirit timeouts do not
                                    affect timeouts available.
                                

For spirit timeouts
                                    lasting five minutes or less, the time taken
                                    for a spirit timeout will automatically be
                                    added to the length of the game time to
                                    determine time caps for the game. After the
                                    initial five minutes, although
                                    spirit captains
                                    may always agree to extend a spirit timeout,
                                    event organizers may limit the time that can
                                    be added to the length of games. The
                                    spirit captain(s)
                                    initiating the spirit timeout will convey
                                    the start and end of the stoppage to
                                    event support staff
                                    or the event organizer for time-keeping
                                    purposes.

Injury, technical, and spirit timeouts are
                    meant to be used exclusively to address the issue for which
                    the timeout was called. Only personnel needed to address the
                    issue should be on the field and only for that purpose.
                    Teams may not use these timeouts as team timeouts, unless
                    they also call a team timeout.
                
Player Substitutions
            

Player substitutions can be completed only:
                    

after a goal and before the
                            substituting team has signaled readiness; or
                        

to replace injured players,
                            replace players with illegal equipment (7.D.3), or to resolve an incorrect personnel violation
                            (9.8.3.a). In this case, the
                            opposing team may substitute a like number of, or
                            fewer, players.
                        



Substitutions are not permitted following a
                    re-pull call, unless in accordance with
                    8.A.2.

Starting and Restarting Play
            

Start of the game:
                    

Representatives of the two teams
                            fairly determine which team chooses to
                            

receive or throw the
                                    initial
                                    pull; or
                                

which end zone they wish
                                    to initially defend.
                                



The other team gets the remaining
                            choice.
                        

The second half begins with a
                            reversal of the initial choices.
                        

If only one team fails to signal
                            readiness for the start of a scheduled game, the
                            opposing team may be awarded goals by the event
                            organizer at a rate of one goal for every five
                            minutes elapsed after the posted start time.
                        



Pull:
                    

Play starts at the beginning of
                            each half and after each goal with a
                            pull.
                        

After a goal, the teams switch
                            their direction of attack and the scoring team
                            pulls.
                        

The
                            pull
                            may be made only after the puller and a player on
                            the receiving team both raise their hands to signal
                            their team’s readiness to begin play. A team
                            must have a minimum of two players and a maximum of
                            seven players on the field in order to signal
                            readiness. The
                            pull
                            occurs when the puller throws (3.K) the disc after signaling readiness.
                            [[Players (3.Q.10) may
                                not signal readiness until all of their other
                                team members are clear of the field (9.C.3.a).]]


If the disc has been
                                    pulled and a team has more than seven (7)
                                    players or has the incorrect mixed personnel
                                    ratio, it is the responsibility of all
                                    players on the field to call violation as
                                    soon as they recognize it.
                                    [[This rule is one of the exceptions to
                                        17.A, and this
                                        violation call is always appropriate
                                        under
                                        2.D.10.]]


The team in
                                            violation must choose which
                                            player(s) to remove from their team,
                                            in the case of too many players, or
                                            substitute, in the case of an
                                            incorrect mixed personnel ratio.
                                        

For every
                                            player removed or substituted by the
                                            team in violation, the other team
                                            may substitute a player.
                                        

After
                                            correcting the violation, the other
                                            team chooses whether to restart the
                                            point using re-pull timings (9.C.5.a) or to restart play as if a team

                                            possession
                                            of the disc, either at
                                            

the
                                                    brick mark closest to the
                                                    end zone that the receiving
                                                    team is defending if
                                                    “brick” was
                                                    called, or
                                                

the
                                                    spot on the long axis of the
                                                    central zone nearest to the
                                                    spot determined by 10.H if
                                                    “middle” was
                                                    called.
                                                







If the
                            pull
                            is caught on the playing field, the disc is
                            in play
                            where it was caught. If the disc is caught outside
                            the playing field, the disc is put into play at the
                            spot on the playing field nearest to where it was
                            caught.
                        

If a player on the receiving team
                            touches the
                            pull
                            before it hits the ground and the disc then hits the
                            ground, it is considered a dropped disc (13.B) and results in a turnover.
                        

After a
                            pull, whichever player takes
                            possession
                            of the disc must put it into play. If a player drops
                            the disc while carrying it to the spot where it is
                            to be put into play and it contacts the ground
                            before the thrower regains
                            possession, the other team gains possession of the disc at
                            the spot on the central zone nearest to the drop.
                        

There is no
                            stoppage of play
                            when putting the
                            pull
                            into play. If the disc is to be put into play at a
                            location other than where
                            possession
                            was gained, the disc is
                            live
                            and the thrower must touch the disc to the ground
                            after establishing a pivot at the appropriate spot
                            on the playing field before attempting a pass.
                        



Time between
                    pulls:
                    

In mixed gender play, the team
                            responsible for signaling the gender ratio for the
                            upcoming point must do so within twenty five (25)
                            seconds after the previous goal was scored.
                            [[The team responsible for signaling gender is
                                encouraged to signal as early as possible after
                                the previous goal is scored, but must do so no
                                later than 25 seconds.]]


Within fifty five (55) seconds
                            after the previous goal was scored, the receiving
                            team must line up for the purpose of allowing the
                            pulling team to match up defensively. Each player
                            must place one foot on the goal line, be visible to
                            the pulling team, and not change their relative
                            position on the line.
                            

Other
                                    team members
                                    (coaches, support staff,
                                    sideline players) may be present on the field during this
                                    time.
                                



Within seventy (70) seconds after
                            the previous goal was scored, the receiving team
                            must signal readiness (9.B.3).
                            

All other
                                    team members
                                    must be clear of the field at this time.
                                



The pulling team must release the
                            pull
                            before the later to occur of:
                            

eighty five (85) seconds
                                    after the previous goal was scored; or
                                

thirty (30) seconds
                                    after the receiving team lined up; or
                                

fifteen (15) seconds
                                    after the receiving team signaled readiness.
                                



On a re-pull,
                            

the receiving team must
                                    signal readiness to play within fifteen (15)
                                    seconds after the call for a re-pull was
                                    made; and
                                

the pulling team must
                                    release the
                                    pull
                                    before the later to occur of:
                                    

thirty (30)
                                            seconds after the call for a re-pull
                                            was made; or
                                        

fifteen (15)
                                            seconds after the receiving team
                                            signaled readiness.
                                        





In games where
                            observers
                            are used, the
                            observers
                            may monitor and call time violations as appropriate.
                            The first instance of a time violation for each team
                            will result in a warning. After a team has received
                            its warning, any further time violations will result
                            in assessment of a team timeout (and the resulting
                            time extensions). If a team has no timeouts
                            remaining, time violations are treated as follows:
                            

Time violation on
                                    receiving team: the receiving team starts
                                    with the disc at the midpoint of the end
                                    zone they are defending, after players set
                                    up and a check is performed.
                                

Time violation on
                                    pulling team: the receiving team starts with
                                    the disc at midfield, after players set up
                                    and a check is performed.
                                



In games where the participants
                            require more time (youth, beginner, or other
                            levels), team
                            captains
                            or tournament organizers (as appropriate) are
                            encouraged to extend the time limits listed above to
                            best suit the level of play.
                        



Check:
                    

When play stops, each player must
                            come to a stop as quickly as possible. Before
                            restarting play, all players must assume the
                            location on the field specified by the rule that
                            covers that specific
                            stoppage of play
                            and remain there until play is restarted.
                        

If a called infraction occurs
                            while play is stopped, any subsequent play is
                            negated and players must assume their appropriate
                            locations under 9.D.1. This
                            called infraction does not alter the stall
                            count.[[Thus any pass attempted will be returned to
                                the thrower.]]


When the situation is resolved,
                            the player determined to be in possession offers the
                            disc to the
                            marker
                            for a check.
                            

The
                                    marker
                                    restarts play by touching the disc in the
                                    thrower’s possession. If the thrower
                                    attempts a pass before the
                                    marker
                                    checks the disc, the pass (whether complete
                                    or incomplete) does not count and the
                                    thrower regains possession.
                                

Any stall count in
                                    effect resumes according to
                                    15.A.5.
                                



Offensive self-check: If play is
                            to restart with a check, but no
                            defensive player
                            is near enough to touch the disc in the
                            thrower’s hand, play restarts with an
                            offensive self-check. To restart play using an
                            offensive self-check:
                            [[Determine this distance based on the thrower
                                standing upright and extending the disc toward
                                the
                                marker.]]


the defense must
                                    acknowledge readiness; and
                                

the thrower establishes
                                    a pivot at the appropriate spot on the
                                    field, touches the disc to the ground and
                                    loudly announces “in play.”
                                



Defensive self-check: If play is
                            to restart with a check, but no
                            offensive player
                            is in possession of the disc at the appropriate
                            spot, play restarts with a defensive self-check. To
                            restart play using a defensive self-check:
                            

the disc is placed at
                                    the appropriate spot on the field;
                                

the offense must
                                    acknowledge readiness; and
                                

the defender closest to
                                    the disc loudly announces “in
                                    play.”
                                






Start of the game:
                    

Representatives of the two teams
                            fairly determine which team chooses to
                            

receive or throw the
                                    initial
                                    pull; or
                                

which end zone they wish
                                    to initially defend.
                                



The other team gets the remaining
                            choice.
                        

The second half begins with a
                            reversal of the initial choices.
                        

If only one team fails to signal
                            readiness for the start of a scheduled game, the
                            opposing team may be awarded goals by the event
                            organizer at a rate of one goal for every five
                            minutes elapsed after the posted start time.
                        


Representatives of the two teams
                            fairly determine which team chooses to
                            

receive or throw the
                                    initial
                                    pull; or
                                

which end zone they wish
                                    to initially defend.
                                


receive or throw the
                                    initial
                                    pull; or
                                
which end zone they wish
                                    to initially defend.
                                
The other team gets the remaining
                            choice.
                        
The second half begins with a
                            reversal of the initial choices.
                        
If only one team fails to signal
                            readiness for the start of a scheduled game, the
                            opposing team may be awarded goals by the event
                            organizer at a rate of one goal for every five
                            minutes elapsed after the posted start time.
                        
Pull:
                    

Play starts at the beginning of
                            each half and after each goal with a
                            pull.
                        

After a goal, the teams switch
                            their direction of attack and the scoring team
                            pulls.
                        

The
                            pull
                            may be made only after the puller and a player on
                            the receiving team both raise their hands to signal
                            their team’s readiness to begin play. A team
                            must have a minimum of two players and a maximum of
                            seven players on the field in order to signal
                            readiness. The
                            pull
                            occurs when the puller throws (3.K) the disc after signaling readiness.
                            [[Players (3.Q.10) may
                                not signal readiness until all of their other
                                team members are clear of the field (9.C.3.a).]]


If the disc has been
                                    pulled and a team has more than seven (7)
                                    players or has the incorrect mixed personnel
                                    ratio, it is the responsibility of all
                                    players on the field to call violation as
                                    soon as they recognize it.
                                    [[This rule is one of the exceptions to
                                        17.A, and this
                                        violation call is always appropriate
                                        under
                                        2.D.10.]]


The team in
                                            violation must choose which
                                            player(s) to remove from their team,
                                            in the case of too many players, or
                                            substitute, in the case of an
                                            incorrect mixed personnel ratio.
                                        

For every
                                            player removed or substituted by the
                                            team in violation, the other team
                                            may substitute a player.
                                        

After
                                            correcting the violation, the other
                                            team chooses whether to restart the
                                            point using re-pull timings (9.C.5.a) or to restart play as if a team
                                            timeout had been called (7.B.4) with the stall count determined
                                            by the applicable violation

                                            15.A.5.a. If
                                            both teams are in violation, the
                                            point should be restarted unless
                                            both teams agree to restart play as
                                            if a team timeout had been called.
                                        

If a violation
                                            of 9.B.3.a is
                                            called after a goal has been scored
                                            and prior to the ensuing pull, the
                                            other team may choose to nullify the
                                            goal and restart the point using
                                            re-pull timings (9.C.5.a).
                                            [[A team must call a violation

                                    move anywhere in their end zone, but their
                                    feet may not break the vertical plane of the
                                    goal line until the disc is released.
                                

After signaling
                                    readiness, players on the receiving team
                                    must have one foot on the goal line that
                                    they are defending without changing location
                                    relative to one another.
                                

After the disc is
                                    released, it is

                                    positioning before the pull, the pulling
                                    team may call “false start” before the
                                    receiving team gains possession of the disc.
                                    The offsides and false start calls do not
                                    stop play, and the Continuation Rule (17.C) does not apply.

                                            into play (per
                                            9.B.6–7). Ten seconds after the player in
                                            possession reaches that location,
                                            each offensive player must establish
                                            a stationary position. Movement
                                            after this time and before the disc
                                            is checked into play is a violation.
                                            The defense has twenty seconds after
                                            all offensive players have
                                            established their positions to check
                                            the disc into play.
                                        

If the pulling
                                            team is offsides and the receiving
                                            team commits a false start, the
                                            offense may put the disc into play
                                            at the appropriate spot for an
                                            offsides but may not attempt a pass
                                            until the disc is checked into play
                                            by the defense.
                                        





A player on the throwing team may
                            not touch the
                            pull
                            in the air before a member of the receiving team
                            touches it. If this violation occurs, the receiving
                            team may request a re-pull immediately.
                        

If the
                            pull
                            hits the ground or an out-of-bounds area untouched,
                            it is put into play as follows:
                            

If the disc initially
                                    hits and remains in-bounds, it is
                                    in play
                                    where it comes to rest or is stopped (17.F).
                                

If the disc initially
                                    hits in-bounds and then becomes
                                    out-of-bounds before being touched by the
                                    receiving team, it is put into play at the
                                    spot on the central zone (i.e., excluding
                                    the end zones) nearest to where it first
                                    crossed the perimeter line to become
                                    out-of-bounds.
                                

If the disc initially
                                    hits in-bounds and then becomes
                                    out-of-bounds after being touched by the
                                    receiving team, it is put into play at the
                                    spot on the playing field nearest to where
                                    it first crossed the perimeter line to
                                    become out-of-bounds.
                                

If the disc initially
                                    hits an out-of-bounds area, the receiving
                                    team may put the disc into play:
                                    

at the spot
                                            determined by
                                            10.H; or
                                        

after
                                            signaling for a brick or middle by
                                            fully extending one hand overhead
                                            and calling brick or middle before
                                            gaining
                                            possession
                                            of the disc, either at
                                            

the
                                                    brick mark closest to the
                                                    end zone that the receiving
                                                    team is defending if
                                                    “brick” was
                                                    called, or
                                                

the
                                                    spot on the long axis of the
                                                    central zone nearest to the
                                                    spot determined by 10.H if
                                                    “middle” was
                                                    called.
                                                







If the
                            pull
                            is caught on the playing field, the disc is
                            in play
                            where it was caught. If the disc is caught outside
                            the playing field, the disc is put into play at the
                            spot on the playing field nearest to where it was
                            caught.
                        

If a player on the receiving team
                            touches the
                            pull
                            before it hits the ground and the disc then hits the
                            ground, it is considered a dropped disc (13.B) and results in a turnover.
                        

After a
                            pull, whichever player takes
                            possession
                            of the disc must put it into play. If a player drops
                            the disc while carrying it to the spot where it is
                            to be put into play and it contacts the ground
                            before the thrower regains
                            possession, the other team gains possession of the disc at
                            the spot on the central zone nearest to the drop.
                        

There is no
                            stoppage of play
                            when putting the
                            pull
                            into play. If the disc is to be put into play at a
                            location other than where
                            possession
                            was gained, the disc is
                            live
                            and the thrower must touch the disc to the ground
                            after establishing a pivot at the appropriate spot
                            on the playing field before attempting a pass.
                        


Play starts at the beginning of
                            each half and after each goal with a
                            pull.
                        
After a goal, the teams switch
                            their direction of attack and the scoring team
                            pulls.
                        
The
                            pull
                            may be made only after the puller and a player on
                            the receiving team both raise their hands to signal
                            their team’s readiness to begin play. A team
                            must have a minimum of two players and a maximum of
                            seven players on the field in order to signal
                            readiness. The
                            pull
                            occurs when the puller throws (3.K) the disc after signaling readiness.
                            [[Players (3.Q.10) may
                                not signal readiness until all of their other
                                team members are clear of the field (9.C.3.a).]]


If the disc has been
                                    pulled and a team has more than seven (7)
                                    players or has the incorrect mixed personnel
                                    ratio, it is the responsibility of all
                                    players on the field to call violation as
                                    soon as they recognize it.

The team in
                                            violation must choose which
                                            player(s) to remove from their team,
                                            in the case of too many players, or
                                            substitute, in the case of an
                                            incorrect mixed personnel ratio.
                                        

For every
                                            player removed or substituted by the
                                            team in violation, the other team
                                            may substitute a player.
                                        

After
                                            correcting the violation, the other
                                            team chooses whether to restart the
                                            point using re-pull timings (9.C.5.a) or to restart play as if a team
                                            timeout had been called (7.B.4) with the stall count determined
                                            by the applicable violation

                                            15.A.5.a. If

                                            point should be restarted unless
                                            both teams agree to restart play as
                                            if a team timeout had been called.
                                        

If a violation
                                            of 9.B.3.a is
                                            called after a goal has been scored

If the pulling

After signaling

                                    move anywhere in their end zone, but their
                                    feet may not break the vertical plane of the
                                    goal line until the disc is released.
                                
After signaling

                                    must have one foot on the goal line that

                                    relative to one another.
                                
After the disc is

                                    team may call “offsides” before gaining

                                    team may call “false start” before the
                                    receiving team gains possession of the disc.
                                    The offsides and false start calls do not
                                    stop play, and the Continuation Rule (17.C) does not apply.

                                            offense may put the disc into play
                                            at the appropriate spot for an

In games where the participants
                            require more time (youth, beginner, or other
                            levels), team

                            or tournament organizers (as appropriate) are
                            encouraged to extend the time limits listed above to
                            best suit the level of play.
                        
Check:
                    

When play stops, each player must
                            come to a stop as quickly as possible. Before
                            restarting play, all players must assume the
                            location on the field specified by the rule that
                            covers that specific
                            stoppage of play
                            and remain there until play is restarted.
                        

If a called infraction occurs
                            while play is stopped, any subsequent play is
                            negated and players must assume their appropriate
                            locations under 9.D.1. This
                            called infraction does not alter the stall
                            count.[[Thus any pass attempted will be returned to
                                the thrower.]]


When the situation is resolved,
                            the player determined to be in possession offers the
                            disc to the
                            marker

                                    checks the disc, the pass (whether complete
                                    or incomplete) does not count and the
                                    thrower regains possession.

In- and Out-of-bounds
            

The entire playing field is in-bounds. The
                    perimeter lines are not part of the playing field and are
                    out-of-bounds.
                

The out-of-bounds area consists of the
                    ground which is not in-bounds and everything in contact
                    (direct or indirect) with it except for players. Any
                    non-players
                    other than
                    observers
                    are considered part of the out-of-bounds area. A disc does
                    not change in- or out-of-bounds status when contacted by an
                    observer.
                

A player contacting the out-of-bounds area
                    is out-of-bounds. A player who is not out-of-bounds is
                    in-bounds. An airborne player retains in-bounds or
                    out-of-bounds status until that player contacts the playing
                    field or the out-of-bounds area. The following exceptions
                    apply:
                    

If momentum carries a player
                            out-of-bounds after landing in-bounds with
                            possession
                            of an in-bounds disc, the player is considered
                            in-bounds. For this exception to apply, that
                            player’s first point of
                            ground contact
                            with any area must be completely in-bounds. The disc
                            is put into play at the spot on the edge of the
                            playing field where the player first went
                            out-of-bounds (unless
                            11.A.2 applies). If the player
                            traversed the end zone being attacked,
                            11.B applies.
                        

A pivoting thrower may contact an
                            out-of-bounds area, provided that part of the pivot
                            remains in contact with the playing field.
                            [[In this case, the player and the disc are
                                considered in-bounds.]]


Contact between players does not
                            confer the state of being in- or out-of-bounds from
                            one to another.
                        



A disc becomes in-bounds when it is put
                    into play, or when play starts or restarts.
                

A disc becomes out-of-bounds when it first
                    contacts the out-of-bounds area, contacts an out-of-bounds
                    offensive player, or is caught by an out-of-bounds
                    defensive player.
                

The disc may fly outside a perimeter line
                    and return to the playing field, and players may go
                    out-of-bounds to make a play on the disc.
                

If an in-bounds defender gains
                    possession
                    while airborne and becomes out-of-bounds while still in
                    possession
                    of the disc, the play is treated as if the defender was
                    out-of-bounds when
                    possession
                    was gained (10.E).
                

To continue play after the disc becomes
                    out-of-bounds, a member of the team gaining possession of
                    the disc must carry it to, and put it into play at, the spot
                    on the central zone nearest to where the most recent of the
                    following events occurred:
                    

the disc completely crossed the
                            perimeter line;
                        

the disc contacted an in-bounds
                            player;
                        

the disc contacted a
                            defensive player; or
                        

the disc became out-of-bounds due
                            to contact with the out-of-bounds area or a player
                            while any part of the disc was inside the perimeter
                            line.
                        


                    After establishing a pivot at the appropriate spot on the
                    field, the thrower must touch the disc to the ground before
                    putting it into play (14.B).
                

Events occurring after the disc becomes
                    out-of-bounds do not affect where it is put into play.
                


The entire playing field is in-bounds. The
                    perimeter lines are not part of the playing field and are
                    out-of-bounds.
                
The out-of-bounds area consists of the
                    ground which is not in-bounds and everything in contact
                    (direct or indirect) with it except for players. Any
                    non-players
                    other than
                    observers
                    are considered part of the out-of-bounds area. A disc does
                    not change in- or out-of-bounds status when contacted by an
                    observer.
                
A player contacting the out-of-bounds area
                    is out-of-bounds. A player who is not out-of-bounds is
                    in-bounds. An airborne player retains in-bounds or
                    out-of-bounds status until that player contacts the playing
                    field or the out-of-bounds area. The following exceptions
                    apply:
                    

If momentum carries a player
                            out-of-bounds after landing in-bounds with
                            possession
                            of an in-bounds disc, the player is considered
                            in-bounds. For this exception to apply, that
                            player’s first point of
                            ground contact
                            with any area must be completely in-bounds. The disc
                            is put into play at the spot on the edge of the
                            playing field where the player first went
                            out-of-bounds (unless
                            11.A.2 applies). If the player
                            traversed the end zone being attacked,
                            11.B applies.
                        

A pivoting thrower may contact an
                            out-of-bounds area, provided that part of the pivot
                            remains in contact with the playing field.
                            [[In this case, the player and the disc are
                                considered in-bounds.]]


Contact between players does not
                            confer the state of being in- or out-of-bounds from
                            one to another.
                        


If momentum carries a player
                            out-of-bounds after landing in-bounds with
                            possession
                            of an in-bounds disc, the player is considered
                            in-bounds. For this exception to apply, that
                            player’s first point of
                            ground contact
                            with any area must be completely in-bounds. The disc
                            is put into play at the spot on the edge of the
                            playing field where the player first went
                            out-of-bounds (unless
                            11.A.2 applies). If the player
                            traversed the end zone being attacked,
                            11.B applies.
                        
A pivoting thrower may contact an
                            out-of-bounds area, provided that part of the pivot
                            remains in contact with the playing field.
                            [[In this case, the player and the disc are
                                considered in-bounds.]]

Contact between players does not
                            confer the state of being in- or out-of-bounds from
                            one to another.
                        
A disc becomes in-bounds when it is put
                    into play, or when play starts or restarts.
                
A disc becomes out-of-bounds when it first
                    contacts the out-of-bounds area, contacts an out-of-bounds
                    offensive player, or is caught by an out-of-bounds
                    defensive player.
                
The disc may fly outside a perimeter line
                    and return to the playing field, and players may go
                    out-of-bounds to make a play on the disc.
                
If an in-bounds defender gains
                    possession
                    while airborne and becomes out-of-bounds while still in
                    possession
                    of the disc, the play is treated as if the defender was
                    out-of-bounds when
                    possession
                    was gained (10.E).
                
To continue play after the disc becomes
                    out-of-bounds, a member of the team gaining possession of
                    the disc must carry it to, and put it into play at, the spot
                    on the central zone nearest to where the most recent of the
                    following events occurred:
                    

the disc completely crossed the
                            perimeter line;
                        

the disc contacted an in-bounds
                            player;
                        

the disc contacted a
                            defensive player; or
                        

the disc became out-of-bounds due
                            to contact with the out-of-bounds area or a player
                            while any part of the disc was inside the perimeter
                            line.
                        


                    After establishing a pivot at the appropriate spot on the
                    field, the thrower must touch the disc to the ground before
                    putting it into play (14.B).

End Zone Possession
            

If a turnover results in a team gaining
                    possession in the end zone that they are defending, the
                    player in possession must immediately either:
                    

establish a pivot at the spot of
                            the disc (to fake a throw or pause after gaining
                            possession
                            commits the player to put the disc into play at that
                            spot); or
                        

carry the disc directly to the
                            closest point on the goal line and put it into play
                            at that spot. If this option is chosen, the player
                            taking possession must put the disc into play at the
                            goal line.
                            [[The player may carry the disc at any speed,
                                constant or variable, while not unreasonably
                                delaying.]]
                            Failure to do so is a travel.
                            [[The player must put the disc into play either
                                at the spot of the disc or on the goal line, not

If a team gains or retains possession in
                    the end zone that they are attacking other than by scoring a
                    goal in accordance with rule 12, the
                    player in possession must carry the disc directly to, and

                    where the player stopped.

Scoring
            

A goal is scored when an in-bounds player
                    catches any legal pass in the end zone of attack, and
                    retains
                    possession
                    of the disc throughout all
                    ground contact
                    related to the catch.
                    

To be considered in the end zone
                            after gaining
                            possession
                            of the disc in accordance with
                            3.J.2 and
                            16.E, the player’s first
                            point of
                            ground contact
                            must be completely in the end zone.

                            will be completely within the end zone loses
                            possession
                            of the disc due to an uncontested
                            foul, or lands out of the end zone due to an
                            uncontested force-out foul (17.I.4.b.4), that player is awarded a goal.
                        



If after receiving a pass outside the end
                    zone, a player comes to a stop contacting the end zone
                    without a pivot on the central zone, that player must carry
                    the disc back to, and put it into play at, the closest spot
                    on the goal line.
                

If a player scores according to
                    12.A, but then unknowingly throws
                    another pass, a goal is awarded to that player, regardless
                    of the outcome of the pass. However, if it is unclear if the
                    player scored according to 12.A (i.e.,
                    there is no agreement on the player who had
                    best perspective, and there are opposing viewpoints on the play), the
                    result of the pass stands.
                

If a player catches the disc and believes a
                    goal has been scored the player may call “goal”
                    and play stops.
                    [[Under 12.A, scoring a goal includes surviving all
                        ground contact related to the catch. Thus,
                        “goal” may not be called if the player did
                        not maintain possession through all ground contact
                        related to the catch, nor may “goal” be
                        called prior to completion of all ground contact related
                        to the catch.]]
                    Best practice is to announce “goal” and raise
                    both hands vertically above the head. After a contested or
                    retracted goal call, play must restart with a check and the
                    call is deemed to have been made when the pass was caught.
                    [[Accordingly, the stall count will resume at 1 (15.5, 15.5.a.5). When
                        repositioning, all players should return to where they

                        “goal” are active observer calls, and player
                        calls are ignored. Therefore, in an observed game, a
                        player’s “goal” call does not stop
                        play.]]
[[If it is ever unclear whether “goal” was
                        called, play continues and 12.C applies to subsequent
                        throws (undisputed goals stand, turnovers stand on

Turnovers
            

A turnover results when:
                    
a pass is incomplete;

a disc contacts the ground while
                            not in possession of a player other than as a result
                            of a
                            pull; or
                        

a disc becomes out-of-bounds
                            other than as a result of a
                            pull.
                        



If the thrower accidentally drops a
                    live
                    disc or a disc
                    in play
                    without defensive interference and it contacts the ground
                    before the thrower regains
                    possession, it is considered a turnover. If the thrower regains
                    possession
                    of an accidentally dropped disc before it contacts the
                    ground without another player touching the disc, that
                    possession is considered continuous.
                    [[An accidentally dropped (falling, non-spinning) disc
                        is not considered in flight. An accidentally released,
                        spinning flying disc is a throw, not a dropped disc, and
                        results in a turnover if the thrower regains possession
                        of the disc without another player touching the
                        disc.]]
[[And the stall count continues uninterrupted.]]
                    If the thrower regains possession of an accidentally dropped
                    disc before it contacts the ground and after another player
                    touches it, it is considered a new possession.
                

A pass is intercepted if a
                    defensive player
                    obtains
                    possession
                    of the disc, but if the defender accidentally loses
                    possession
                    of the disc before or during
                    ground contact
                    related to the catch, the pass is considered incomplete
                    rather than intercepted.
                    [[i.e., this is not a “double-turnover”
                        – the defender’s team still gains
                        possession.]]


The following actions result in a turnover
                    and a

The thrower hands the disc to
                            another player.
                        

The thrower catches a legally
                            thrown disc. However, it is not a turnover if
                            another player touches the disc during its flight
                            unless the thrower intentionally deflected the disc
                            off another player.

                    touches it, it is considered a new possession.
                
A pass is intercepted if a

                    of the disc, but if the defender accidentally loses
                    possession
                    of the disc before or during
                    ground contact
                    related to the catch, the pass is considered incomplete
                    rather than intercepted.

                    may take possession of it.

                            in play, the thrower must establish a pivot at the spot of

If the count resets to
                                    one during a
                                    stoppage of play, it is considered a new count.
                                



Only the
                            marker
                            (3.Q.6) may initiate or
                            continue a stall count, and may do so anytime a
                            thrower has possession of a disc that is
                            live
                            or
                            in play.
                            

Additionally, the
                                    marker may initiate or continue a stall
                                    count (even before a thrower gains
                                    possession) if delay of game or pre-stall
                                    rules (14.A.3,
                                    14.A.4,
                                    14.A.5, or
                                    7.B.4.d) apply and
                                    have been satisfied.
                                

However, unless
                                    15.A.2.a applies,
                                    the stall count may not be initiated or
                                    resumed before a pivot is established:
                                    

directly after a turnover,


when putting the pull into
                                                play, and


after a travel is called and no
                                                pass has been attempted.






If the thrower has not released
                            the disc at the first utterance of the word
                            “ten,” it is a turnover. The
                            marker
                            loudly announces “stall” and play stops.
                            If the disc is thrown, play continues until the
                            outcome of that pass is determined. A stall is not a
                            violation and the Continuation Rule (17.C) does not apply.
                            

If the stall is
                                    uncontested, the disc is returned to the
                                    thrower at the place of the stall. The
                                    thrower then places the disc on the ground
                                    and loudly announces “disc in”
                                    and the disc is
                                    in play.
                                

The thrower may contest
                                    a stall call in the belief that the disc was
                                    released before the first utterance of the
                                    word “ten” or if the
                                    marker
                                    committed a fast count such that the thrower
                                    did not have a reasonable opportunity to
                                    call “fast count” before the
                                    first utterance of the word
                                    “ten.” If a stall is contested:
                                    

If the pass was
                                            complete or
                                            15.B.1.b
                                            applies, play stops, players return
                                            to their positions at the time of
                                            the throw, and possession reverts to
                                            the thrower. After a check, the
                                            marker
                                            resumes the stall count according to
                                            15.A.5.b.3.
                                        

If the pass
                                            was incomplete, it is a turnover;
                                            play stops and resumes with a check.
                                        

If a stall
                                            call is retracted and the thrower
                                            attempted a pass, the outcome of the
                                            pass stands and play restarts with a
                                            check.
                                            [[A
                                                marker
                                                should not automatically call
                                                “stall” because they
                                                got to the count of ten. They
                                                should be certain that the disc
                                                was not yet released and that
                                                their count wasn’t
                                                fast.]]






If the defense switches
                            markers, the new
                            marker
                            must reinitiate the stall count.

If a stall count is interrupted
                            by a call, the thrower and
                            marker

                                    [[Skipping multiple numbers at once in
                                        the count is immediately callable as a
                                        general violation.]]


If a fast count occurs
                                    in such a manner that the thrower does not
                                    have a reasonable opportunity to call fast
                                    count before the first utterance of the word
                                    ten, the play is treated as a contested
                                    stall (15.A.3.b).
                                

If this (15.B.1.b) occurs in the same possession following a
                                    contested stall (either due to
                                    15.B.1.a or
                                    15.A.3.b), the stall
                                    count resumes at six.
                                



Double team: If a
                            defensive player
                            other than the
                            marker
                            is within 10 feet of any pivot of the thrower
                            without also being within 10 feet of and
                            guarding
                            (3.E) another
                            offensive player, it is a double team. However, merely running
                            across this area is not a double team.
                            [[“Merely running” means running
                                for the exclusive purpose of reaching the other
                                side. Running with an ulterior motive of
                                interfering with the thrower in any way is not
                                “merely running” and is a double
                                team.]]


Disc space:
                            

It is a disc space
                                    violation if:
                                    

any part of
                                            the
                                            marker
                                            is less than one disc diameter away
                                            from the torso of the thrower; or
                                        

a line
                                            between any two points on the
                                            marker


touches the thrower; or
                                                

is
                                                    less than one disc diameter
                                                    away from the torso or pivot
                                                    of the thrower.
                                                





Straddle: If a line
                                    between the
                                    marker’s
                                    feet is less than one disc diameter away
                                    from the pivot of the thrower, it is a
                                    straddle violation.
                                

Wrapping: If a line
                                    between the
                                    marker’s
                                    hands is less than one disc diameter away
                                    from the torso or pivot of the thrower, it
                                    is a wrapping violation.
                                    [[The thrower may choose to call
                                        “disc space” for both
                                        straddle and wrapping violations as they
                                        are a subset of disc space violations.
                                        However, the thrower may also choose to
                                        call the more specific violation for
                                        clearer communication to the
                                        marker
                                        about what needs to be
                                        corrected.]]


However, if any of the
                                    above situations are caused solely by
                                    movement of the thrower, it is not a
                                    violation.
                                



Vision blocking: If the
                            marker
                            deliberately blocks the thrower’s vision, it
                            is a vision blocking violation.
                        

Fast count, double team, disc
                            space, straddle, wrapping, and vision blocking are
                            marking violations.
                        

Only the thrower may call a
                            marking violation, and to do so must call out the
                            name of the specific marking violation.
                        

When a marking violation is
                            called, play does not stop. The violation must be
                            corrected before the
                            marker
                            can resume the stall count with the number last
                            uttered before the call minus one (e.g.
                            “stalling
                            one…two…three…” “fast
                            count”
                            “…two…three…”).
                            [[When a marking violation is called, the

                                should immediately stop counting. The defense
                                should then correct the violation and the
                                marker
                                can then resume the count at the appropriate
                                number.]]
                            If the
                            marker
                            resumes the stall count before the defense corrects
                            a marking violation, it is another instance of the
                            original marking violation, which may be called by
                            the thrower.
                        

If the defense commits a marking
                            violation after being called for a marking violation
                            during the same stall count (15.A.1) but before the thrower is in the act of throwing,
                            the thrower may choose to either call another
                            marking violation or to treat the marking violation
                            as a general defensive violation (17). To treat it as a general violation, the thrower
                            must call “violation.”
                        

The
                            marker
                            may contest a marking violation by calling
                            “violation.” This contest is treated as
                            the call of an offensive violation, and the
                            Continuation Rule (17.C)
                            applies.
                            [[It is the
                                marker’s
                                responsibility to announce if play was affected
                                for the purpose of the Continuation Rule (17.C). Generally speaking, due to
                                17.L, calls made by another
                                player cannot be said to affect play. However,
                                in limited situations for contested marking
                                violation calls, when the
                                marker
                                diverts their attention away from marking while
                                reasonably and quickly assessing the conditions
                                to the thrower’s marking violation call,
                                the
                                marker
                                could determine that play was affected. For
                                example, the thrower calls straddle, and while
                                the
                                marker
                                is looking at their feet to assess their marking
                                position, the thrower completes a throw around
                                the
                                marker. If the
                                marker
                                subsequently contests the straddle because they
                                assessed that they weren’t committing a
                                marking violation, they could claim that play
                                was affected and the disc should be returned to
                                the thrower. It is the thrower’s
                                responsibility to stop play as soon as possible
                                after the
                                marker
                                makes their call contesting the marking
                                violation (20.F).]]





Stalling: The period of time within which a
                    thrower must release a throw may be timed by the stall
                    count.
                    

The stall count consists of
                            announcing “stalling” and counting from
                            one to ten loudly enough for the thrower to hear.
                            

The interval between
                                    the first utterance of each number in the
                                    stall count must be at least one second.
                                    [[Thus, a legal count from one to ten
                                        will take a minimum of 9 seconds. It is
                                        legal count at intervals greater than
                                        one second between numbers]]


All stall counts
                                    initiated, reinitiated or resumed after a
                                    stoppage of play
                                    must start with the word
                                    “stalling.”
                                

If the count resets to
                                    one during a
                                    stoppage of play, it is considered a new count.
                                



Only the
                            marker
                            (3.Q.6) may initiate or
                            continue a stall count, and may do so anytime a
                            thrower has possession of a disc that is
                            live
                            or
                            in play.
                            

Additionally, the
                                    marker may initiate or continue a stall
                                    count (even before a thrower gains
                                    possession) if delay of game or pre-stall
                                    rules (14.A.3,
                                    14.A.4,
                                    14.A.5, or
                                    7.B.4.d) apply and
                                    have been satisfied.
                                

However, unless
                                    15.A.2.a applies,
                                    the stall count may not be initiated or
                                    resumed before a pivot is established:
                                    

directly after a turnover,


when putting the pull into
                                                play, and


after a travel is called and no
                                                pass has been attempted.






If the thrower has not released
                            the disc at the first utterance of the word
                            “ten,” it is a turnover. The
                            marker
                            loudly announces “stall” and play stops.
                            If the disc is thrown, play continues until the
                            outcome of that pass is determined. A stall is not a
                            violation and the Continuation Rule (17.C) does not apply.
                            

If the stall is
                                    uncontested, the disc is returned to the
                                    thrower at the place of the stall. The
                                    thrower then places the disc on the ground
                                    and loudly announces “disc in”
                                    and the disc is
                                    in play.
                                

The thrower may contest
                                    a stall call in the belief that the disc was
                                    released before the first utterance of the
                                    word “ten” or if the
                                    marker
                                    committed a fast count such that the thrower
                                    did not have a reasonable opportunity to
                                    call “fast count” before the
                                    first utterance of the word
                                    “ten.” If a stall is contested:
                                    

If the pass was
                                            complete or
                                            15.B.1.b
                                            applies, play stops, players return
                                            to their positions at the time of
                                            the throw, and possession reverts to
                                            the thrower. After a check, the
                                            marker
                                            resumes the stall count according to
                                            15.A.5.b.3.
                                        

If the pass
                                            was incomplete, it is a turnover;
                                            play stops and resumes with a check.
                                        

If a stall
                                            call is retracted and the thrower
                                            attempted a pass, the outcome of the
                                            pass stands and play restarts with a
                                            check.

                                                should be certain that the disc
                                                was not yet released and that
                                                their count wasn’t

If the defense switches

The stall count consists of
                            announcing “stalling” and counting from
                            one to ten loudly enough for the thrower to hear.

                                        will take a minimum of 9 seconds. It is

Disc space:
                            

It is a disc space

any part of

Wrapping: If a line
                                    between the
                                    marker’s
                                    hands is less than one disc diameter away
                                    from the torso or pivot of the thrower, it
                                    is a wrapping violation.
                                    [[The thrower may choose to call
                                        “disc space” for both
                                        straddle and wrapping violations as they
                                        are a subset of disc space violations.
                                        However, the thrower may also choose to
                                        call the more specific violation for
                                        clearer communication to the
                                        marker

                                        corrected.]]


However, if any of the
                                    above situations are caused solely by
                                    movement of the thrower, it is not a
                                    violation.
                                



Vision blocking: If the
                            marker
                            deliberately blocks the thrower’s vision, it
                            is a vision blocking violation.
                        

Fast count, double team, disc
                            space, straddle, wrapping, and vision blocking are
                            marking violations.
                        

Only the thrower may call a
                            marking violation, and to do so must call out the
                            name of the specific marking violation.
                        

When a marking violation is
                            called, play does not stop. The violation must be
                            corrected before the
                            marker
                            can resume the stall count with the number last
                            uttered before the call minus one (e.g.
                            “stalling
                            one…two…three…” “fast
                            count”

                                should immediately stop counting. The defense
                                should then correct the violation and the
                                marker
                                can then resume the count at the appropriate
                                number.]]
                            If the
                            marker
                            resumes the stall count before the defense corrects
                            a marking violation, it is another instance of the
                            original marking violation, which may be called by
                            the thrower.
                        

If the defense commits a marking
                            violation after being called for a marking violation
                            during the same stall count (15.A.1) but before the thrower is in the act of throwing,
                            the thrower may choose to either call another
                            marking violation or to treat the marking violation
                            as a general defensive violation (17). To treat it as a general violation, the thrower
                            must call “violation.”
                        

The
                            marker
                            may contest a marking violation by calling
                            “violation.” This contest is treated as
                            the call of an offensive violation, and the
                            Continuation Rule (17.C)
                            applies.
                            [[It is the
                                marker’s
                                responsibility to announce if play was affected
                                for the purpose of the Continuation Rule (17.C). Generally speaking, due to
                                17.L, calls made by another
                                player cannot be said to affect play. However,
                                in limited situations for contested marking
                                violation calls, when the
                                marker
                                diverts their attention away from marking while
                                reasonably and quickly assessing the conditions
                                to the thrower’s marking violation call,
                                the
                                marker
                                could determine that play was affected. For
                                example, the thrower calls straddle, and while
                                the
                                marker
                                is looking at their feet to assess their marking
                                position, the thrower completes a throw around
                                the
                                marker. If the
                                marker
                                subsequently contests the straddle because they
                                assessed that they weren’t committing a
                                marking violation, they could claim that play
                                was affected and the disc should be returned to
                                the thrower. It is the thrower’s
                                responsibility to stop play as soon as possible
                                after the
                                marker
                                makes their call contesting the marking
                                violation (20.F).]]

Only the thrower may call a

                            a marking violation, it is another instance of the
                            original marking violation, which may be called by
                            the thrower.
                        
If the defense commits a marking
                            violation after being called for a marking violation
                            during the same stall count (15.A.1) but before the thrower is in the act of throwing,
                            the thrower may choose to either call another
                            marking violation or to treat the marking violation
                            as a general defensive violation (17). To treat it as a general violation, the thrower
                            must call “violation.”
                        
The
                            marker
                            may contest a marking violation by calling
                            “violation.” This contest is treated as
                            the call of an offensive violation, and the
                            Continuation Rule (17.C)
                            applies.
                            [[It is the

                                for the purpose of the Continuation Rule (17.C). Generally speaking, due to
                                17.L, calls made by another
                                player cannot be said to affect play. However,
                                in limited situations for contested marking
                                violation calls, when the
                                marker
                                diverts their attention away from marking while
                                reasonably and quickly assessing the conditions
                                to the thrower’s marking violation call,
                                the
                                marker
                                could determine that play was affected. For
                                example, the thrower calls straddle, and while
                                the
                                marker
                                is looking at their feet to assess their marking
                                position, the thrower completes a throw around
                                the
                                marker. If the
                                marker
                                subsequently contests the straddle because they
                                assessed that they weren’t committing a
                                marking violation, they could claim that play
                                was affected and the disc should be returned to
                                the thrower. It is the thrower’s
                                responsibility to stop play as soon as possible
                                after the
                                marker
                                makes their call contesting the marking
                                violation (20.F).]]

The Receiver
            

A player may bobble the disc in order to
                    gain control of it, but purposeful bobbling (including
                    tipping, delaying, guiding, brushing or the like) to oneself
                    in order to advance the disc in any direction from where it
                    initially was contacted is considered traveling.
                    [[Tipping, brushing, etc. to someone else is legal. It
                        is legal to tip/brush your own throw. However, if after
                        a tip/brush, one is the first player to touch the disc,
                        then it is deemed a tip/brush to oneself and it is a
                        travel.]]
[[Remember, you can bobble for the purpose of gaining
                        control, so kicking the disc up to yourself to help
                        catch it would be legal. But tipping the disc for the
                        purpose of evading a defender would not be
                        legal.]]


After catching a pass, a player is required
                    to come to a stop as quickly as possible and establish a
                    pivot.
                

If a player catches the disc while running
                    or jumping the player may release a pass without attempting
                    to stop and without setting a pivot, provided that:
                    

the player does not change
                            direction or increase speed while in
                            possession
                            of the disc; and
                        

the pass is released before three
                            additional points of contact with the ground are
                            made after
                            possession
                            has been established.
                        



If offensive and
                    defensive player
                    catch the disc simultaneously, the offense retains
                    possession.
                

If it is unclear whether a catch was made
                    before the disc contacted the ground (grass is considered
                    part of the ground), or whether a player’s first point
                    of
                    ground contact
                    after catching the disc was in- or out-of-bounds or in or
                    out of the end zone, the player with the
                    best perspective
                    makes the call.
                


A player may bobble the disc in order to
                    gain control of it, but purposeful bobbling (including
                    tipping, delaying, guiding, brushing or the like) to oneself
                    in order to advance the disc in any direction from where it
                    initially was contacted is considered traveling.
                    [[Tipping, brushing, etc. to someone else is legal. It
                        is legal to tip/brush your own throw. However, if after
                        a tip/brush, one is the first player to touch the disc,
                        then it is deemed a tip/brush to oneself and it is a
                        travel.]]
[[Remember, you can bobble for the purpose of gaining
                        control, so kicking the disc up to yourself to help
                        catch it would be legal. But tipping the disc for the
                        purpose of evading a defender would not be
                        legal.]]

After catching a pass, a player is required
                    to come to a stop as quickly as possible and establish a
                    pivot.
                
If a player catches the disc while running
                    or jumping the player may release a pass without attempting
                    to stop and without setting a pivot, provided that:
                    

the player does not change
                            direction or increase speed while in
                            possession
                            of the disc; and
                        

the pass is released before three
                            additional points of contact with the ground are
                            made after
                            possession
                            has been established.

                    catch the disc simultaneously, the offense retains

If it is unclear whether a catch was made
                    before the disc contacted the ground (grass is considered

                    of
                    ground contact
                    after catching the disc was in- or out-of-bounds or in or
                    out of the end zone, the player with the
                    best perspective
                    makes the call.
                
Violations and Fouls
            

An infraction may only be called by a
                    player on the infracted team who recognizes that it has
                    occurred, unless specified differently elsewhere.
                    [[The player must know that a specific rule was
                        violated and have perceived the particular action with
                        certainty. A player may not call an infraction whenever
                        the player maybe recognizes that some infraction might
                        have occurred.]]
                    The player must immediately call “violation” or
                    the name of the specific infraction loudly.
                

A player called for an infraction may
                    contest that call if that player believes the infraction did
                    not occur.
                    [[This belief may be based on the player’s
                        perspective on the particular sequence of events or
                        based on a disagreement over the application of the
                        rules, provided the player has read and understands the
                        rules. For example, “No, I didn’t slap your
                        hand” or “Tipping the disc to someone else
                        is not a travel.”]]


Any time an infraction is called, the
                    Continuation Rule applies. Continuation Rule: Play stops
                    when the thrower in possession acknowledges that an
                    infraction has been called.
                    [[This refers to the thrower who possesses the disc or
                        has just released the disc at the time of the
                        infraction/call. Who the thrower (3.O.5) is is determined at the time of the
                        infraction/call.]]
                    If a call is made when the disc is in the air or the thrower
                    is in the act of throwing, or if the thrower fails to
                    acknowledge the call and subsequently attempts a pass, play
                    continues until the outcome of that pass is determined. For
                    the purpose of the Continuation Rule, an uncontested stall
                    that occurs after another call is treated the same as an
                    incomplete pass.
                    [[Thus, if you get stalled before you acknowledge a
                        call, it is treated the same as if you ignored the call
                        and threw a turnover.]]
                    Play then either stops or continues according to the
                    following:
                    

Despite any outcome dictated by
                            these rules, if the involved players on both teams
                            agree that the infraction did not affect the outcome
                            of the play, play stops and the result of the play
                            stands. This provision does not apply if the thrower
                            is aware an infraction has been called and
                            subsequently attempts a pass.
                        

Where the outcome of these rules
                            is for play to continue unhalted, the player who
                            called the infraction must announce “play
                            on.” Additionally, any player recognizing that
                            play should continue without stoppage should
                            announce “play on.” If the player who
                            called the infraction does not announce “play
                            on” and the opposing team is uncertain whether
                            play should continue, the opposing team has the
                            option to stop play by calling
                            “violation.”
                        

For calls made by the offense:
                            

If the pass is
                                    complete:
                                    

If the
                                            offense called the infraction before
                                            the thrower began the act of
                                            throwing (3.O.3), play stops and possession
                                            reverts to the thrower.
                                        

If the
                                            offense called the infraction after
                                            the thrower began the act of
                                            throwing, play continues unhalted.
                                        

Where an
                                            infraction is called by the thrower,
                                            players should treat the call as if
                                            it was made when the infraction
                                            occurred in determining whether the
                                            call was made before or after the
                                            thrower was in the act of throwing.
                                            If the infraction occurred after the
                                            throw was released, the call is
                                            considered to have been made by a
                                            non-thrower.
                                            [[This means that if you throw
                                                a turnover and call a foul on
                                                contact after the release, the
                                                turnover will generally stand.
                                                Note that the timing is based on
                                                when the infraction occurred for
                                                this rule.]]




If the pass is
                                    incomplete:
                                    

If the
                                            infraction affected the play (17.C.5), play stops and the disc reverts
                                            to the thrower unless the specific
                                            rule (e.g., the receiving foul rule)
                                            says otherwise.
                                        

If the
                                            infraction did not affect the play,

                                            play stands.
                                        

Where the
                                            thrower calls an infraction which
                                            occurred before the thrower began
                                            the act of throwing, play continues
                                            unhalted and the result of the play
                                            stands.
                                        





For calls made by the defense:
                            

If the pass is
                                    complete:
                                    

If the
                                            infraction affected the play (17.C.5), play stops and the disc reverts
                                            to the thrower unless the specific
                                            rule (e.g., the receiving foul rule)
                                            says otherwise.
                                        

If the
                                            infraction did not affect the play,
                                            play stops and the result of the
                                            play stands.
                                        



If the pass is
                                    incomplete, play continues un-halted.
                                



An infraction affected the play
                            if an infracted player determines that the outcome
                            of the specific play, from the time of the
                            infraction until play stops, may have been
                            meaningfully different absent the infraction.
                            [[It is the infracted player’s
                                responsibility to announce if play was affected.
                                For example, if a defender calls
                                “pick” while trailing a receiver by
                                6 feet, the defender should indicate whether the
                                pick affected the play. If the pick did not
                                affect the play, the defender will still recover
                                any distance lost, but the
                                completed pass
                                will stand. If the pick did affect the play, the
                                disc reverts to the thrower.]]
                            For example, if a receiver is fouled and thereby
                            prevented from getting open for a pass, the play was
                            affected; however, if the receiver would not have
                            received a pass even without the foul, the play was
                            not affected.
                            [[Contact that occurs after the outcome of the
                                play is determined cannot affect the play. For
                                example, if a defender catches a disc before
                                lightly bumping into the receiver, that contact
                                did not affect the play and the turnover will
                                stand.]]


Positioning after a call:
                            

If no pass is thrown or
                                    attempted before the thrower stops play by
                                    acknowledging the call, all players return
                                    to the locations they occupied when the call
                                    was made.
                                

If a pass is thrown or

                                    the call or the call is made after the
                                    throwing attempt, and
                                    

if possession
                                            reverts to the thrower, all players
                                            return to the locations they
                                            occupied at the earlier of:
                                            [[Therefore, if a long pass is
                                                thrown and there is a contested
                                                receiving foul, the players will
                                                return to where they were at the
                                                time of the throw (rather than
                                                remaining downfield after
                                                chasing down the disc).]]


the
                                                    time of the throw,
                                                

the
                                                    time of the call.
                                                



if a player
                                            other than the thrower is awarded
                                            possession due to an uncontested
                                            call, all players return to the
                                            locations they occupied at the time
                                            of the infraction.
                                        

if the result
                                            of a play stands, players return to
                                            the locations they occupied when
                                            play stopped.
                                        







If a player makes a play-halting call and
                    subsequently determines that their call was incorrect, they
                    should retract the call by announcing
                    “retracted.” Play still stops. Play restarts
                    with a check and the stall resumes according to
                    15.A.5.a.
                    [[This includes a player incorrectly stopping play
                        because they thought they heard a call such as “pick”
                        and echoed the call.]]


If a dispute arises concerning an
                    infraction or the outcome of a play (e.g., a catch where no
                    one had a good perspective), and the teams cannot come to a
                    satisfactory resolution, play stops, and the disc is
                    returned to the thrower and put into play with a check (9.D), with the count reached plus one or at six if over five.
                

Any player may stop a rolling or sliding
                    disc, but advancing it in any direction is a violation.
                

If an infraction results in possession
                    reverting to a thrower who was airborne when releasing the
                    disc, play restarts at the spot on the playing field closest
                    to the point of release.
                    [[This applies to throwers attempting a
                        “greatest” or any other airborne
                        thrower.]]


If multiple infractions occur on the same
                    play or before play stops, the outcomes should be resolved
                    in reverse sequence (latest infraction first, earliest
                    infraction last).
                    

If an earlier infraction is
                            determined not to have affected the play (17.C.1
                            and 17.C.5), that infraction
                            is not resolved and it does not affect the
                            resolution of subsequent infractions.
                            [[Not resolved essentially means that the call
                                is treated as if it had not occurred and the
                                result of the play (possession, stall count,
                                etc.) is unchanged by that call.]]


Offsetting infractions: If both
                            offensive and defensive infractions occur
                            simultaneously or the sequence cannot be determined,
                            the resolution for this set of infractions is: the
                            disc is returned to the thrower and put into play
                            with a check, with the count reached plus one or at
                            six if over five.
                            [[It is possible that resolutions to earlier
                                infractions may ultimately change this
                                particular outcome.]]


Exception: If separate
                            fouls
                            occur while the disc is in the air, but before any
                            player starts to attempt to catch or block the disc,
                            those
                            fouls
                            are treated as simultaneous and on the same play.
                        

[[Examples: 


                                A receiver and their opponent contact each other
                                and both call fouls against the other.
                                17.H.2 applies, and the
                                disc is returned to the thrower and put into
                                play with a check, with the count reached plus
                                one or at six if over five.
                            

                                Two different receiver-opponent pairs call fouls
                                — one against the offense and one against
                                the defense — while the disc is in the
                                air, but before anyone starts trying to catch
                                it. 17.H.3 applies in this
                                case, even if the fouls occur several seconds
                                apart. The disc is returned to the thrower and
                                put into play with a check, with the count
                                reached plus one or at six if over five.
                            

                                The
                                marker
                                calls an offensive foul on the thrower during
                                the throw, then later a receiver calls a
                                defensive foul on a defender during the
                                reception on an incomplete pass. The fouls are
                                resolved in reverse sequence. First, the
                                receiving foul is resolved (here, assumed
                                uncontested), granting possession to the
                                offensive receiver, then the throwing foul is
                                resolved (here, assumed uncontested), returning
                                the disc to the thrower with the count reached
                                plus one (max nine). The earlier infraction
                                (offensive foul on the thrower) takes precedence
                                over the later infraction (defensive foul on the
                                receiver), resulting in the disc returning to
                                the original thrower.]]
                            




Fouls (3.C): It is the
                    responsibility of all players to avoid contact in every way
                    possible.
                    [[Avoid contact in every way reasonably possible, while
                        still playing ultimate. Some contact is inevitable, but
                        players have an affirmative obligation to make
                        reasonable efforts to avoid contact.]]


Dangerous Play. Actions
                            demonstrating reckless disregard for the safety of
                            or posing a significant risk of injury to fellow
                            players, or other dangerously aggressive behavior
                            are considered “dangerous play” and are
                            treated as a
                            foul. The proper call in such circumstances is
                            “dangerous play” and play stops. This
                            rule is not superseded by any other rule.
                            [[The following are non-exhaustive examples of
                                dangerous play:
                                

                                        significantly colliding with a mostly
                                        stationary opponent,

                                        results in contact with a player’s
                                        back or legs,
                                    

                                        running without looking when there is a
                                        likelihood of other players occupying
                                        the space into which the player is
                                        traveling,

                                        where it is likely that a significant
                                        collision will result,
                                    

                                        wild or uncontrolled throwing motions,
                                    

                                        initiating contact with a player’s

                                        player in a manner where contact is
                                        unavoidable]]
                                    



Dangerous play is
                                    considered a foul regardless of whether or
                                    when the disc arrives or contact occurs.
                                    

The vast
                                            majority of dangerous play will
                                            involve contact between players.
                                            However, contact is not required for
                                            a player to invoke this rule where
                                            there is reasonable certainty that
                                            contact would have occurred had the
                                            player not taken steps to avoid
                                            contact.
                                            [[A player is not required to
                                                hold their position and receive
                                                contact in order to call
                                                “dangerous play,”
                                                but the mere possibility of
                                                contact is insufficient to
                                                justify a call. Furthermore, if
                                                the offending player stops or
                                                changes their path such that
                                                contact would not have occurred,
                                                contact was not
                                                “reasonably
                                                certain.”]]




Resolution. If
                                    uncontested, a call of “dangerous
                                    play” is resolved as an analogous foul
                                    (e.g., if the call occurred while or
                                    immediately after the calling player was
                                    making a play on a disc in the air, it is
                                    treated as a Receiving Foul (17.I.4.b)). A player called for dangerous play may
                                    contest the call if they believe the call

Dangerous

                                            a play on the disc. However, the

                                            foul, if the player determines that
                                            the dangerous play was unrelated to
                                            the overall play that decided the

                                                of the play is determined
                                                already and the contact is not
                                                an infraction of this

Force-out
                                            Foul: If an airborne player catches
                                            the disc and is contacted by an
                                            opposing player before landing, and
                                            that contact causes the player to
                                            land out-of-bounds instead of
                                            in-bounds, or out of the end zone
                                            instead of in the end zone, it is a
                                            foul on the opposing player and the
                                            fouled player retains possession at
                                            the spot of the foul. If an
                                            uncontested force-out foul results
                                            in an in-bounds player landing
                                            outside the end zone being attacked
                                            when they would have landed in the
                                            end zone without the foul, a goal is
                                            awarded.
                                        



Blocking Fouls:
                                    

When the disc
                                            is in the air a player may not move
                                            in a manner solely to prevent an
                                            opponent from taking an unoccupied
                                            path to the disc and any resulting
                                            non-incidental contact
                                            is a foul on the blocking player
                                            which is treated like a receiving
                                            foul (17.I.4.b).
                                            [[Solely. The intent of the
                                                player’s movement can be

                                                opponent from taking an
                                                unoccupied path to the disc, so
                                                long as it is part of a general
                                                effort to make a play on the
                                                disc. Note, if a trailing player
                                                runs into a player in front of
                                                them, it is nearly always a foul
                                                on the trailing player.]]


A player may
                                            not take a position that is
                                            unavoidable by a moving opponent
                                            when time, distance, and line of
                                            sight are considered.

                                            resulting from taking such a
                                            position is a foul on the blocking
                                            player.
                                        



Strip: If a

                                    of the disc, it is a strip. A strip is a
                                    subset of fouls and is treated the same way.

[[Sustained contact with, and control

                                        establish
                                        possession
                                        (3.J). A player may
                                        not call a strip if they had only
                                        momentary contact with or lacked control

                                        did not have possession.]]






Picks:
                    

A pick occurs whenever an
                            offensive player
                            moves in a manner that causes a
                            defensive player
guarding
                            (3.E) an
                            offensive player
                            to be obstructed by another player. Obstruction may
                            result from contact with, or the need to avoid, the
                            obstructing player.
                        

A pick can be called only by the
                            obstructed player and must be announced by loudly
                            calling “pick” immediately after it
                            occurs.
                            [[Call the pick immediately. If you wait too
                                long, you lose your window of opportunity to
                                make the call.]]


If play stops according to
                            17.C, players reposition
                            according to 17.C.6.
                            [[So if the disc is returned to the thrower,
                                everyone resumes the locations they occupied at
                                the earlier of the time of the throw or the time
                                of the call.]]
                            In addition, the obstructed player is then allowed
                            to move to recover the relative position lost
                            because of the pick.
                            [[Then the picked defender catches up the
                                relative position lost because of the pick. If
                                they were trailing by 9 feet, then they get to
                                catch back up to 9 feet away, but does not get
                                to set up right next to the
                                offensive player.]]


During any
                            stoppage of play, opposing players may agree to slightly adjust
                            their locations to avoid potential imminent picks.
                        



Traveling: The thrower must establish and
                    continually maintain a
                    pivot
                    at the appropriate spot on the field until the throw is
                    released. Failure to do so is a travel and is resolved
                    according to 17.K.3, below.
                    [[Resolved according to
                        17.K.3 only if the travel is
                        called, otherwise play continues uninterrupted.]]


In addition, each of the
                            following is a travel:
                            

A player catches the
                                    disc and either speeds up, changes direction
                                    or does not stop as quickly as possible
                                    before establishing a
                                    pivot
                                    (16.B).
                                

A player receives a
                                    pass while running or jumping, and releases
                                    a pass after the third additional
                                    ground contact
                                    and before establishing a
                                    pivot
                                    (16.C).
                                

Purposeful bobbling
                                    (including tipping, delaying, guiding,
                                    brushing, or the like) to oneself in order
                                    to advance the disc in any direction from
                                    where it initially was contacted (16.A).
                                    

If a defender
                                            commits this infraction and the
                                            result of the play is a turnover,
                                            the defender retains possession at
                                            the initial spot of the travel.
                                        



The thrower fails to
                                    touch the disc to the ground when required
                                    (14.B).
                                



Exceptions:
                            

If a non-standing
                                    player loses contact with the
                                    pivot
                                    spot in order to stand up, it is not a
                                    travel, provided the new pivot is
                                    established at the same location.
                                

It is not a travel if a
                                    player catches the disc and releases a pass
                                    before three additional points of
                                    ground contact
                                    (16.C).
                                

If play stops, the
                                    thrower may reset the
                                    pivot.
                                



Resolutions:
                            

If the travel occurs
                                    and a pass is thrown:
                                    

If the pass
                                            is incomplete, play continues
                                            uninterrupted (as per the
                                            Continuation Rule,
                                            17.C.4.b).
                                        

If the pass
                                            is complete, play stops and the disc
                                            is returned to the thrower where the
                                            travel occurred (as per the
                                            Continuation Rule,

                                                pivot
                                                was more than one step from the
                                                appropriate spot, the following
                                                procedure is used instead:
                                                First, the disc is checked in
                                                where the thrower threw the
                                                pass, making it
                                                live, then the thrower walks to the
                                                appropriate spot for their
                                                pivot
                                                and puts the disc
                                                in play. At this point, the stall
                                                count may resume.]]




If the travel occurs
                                    and no pass has been attempted:
                                    

Play does not
                                            stop. The defense (typically the
                                            marker) points to the spot where the
                                            travel occurred, and the thrower
                                            returns to that spot without delay.
                                            The thrower must touch the disc to
                                            the ground before attempting a legal
                                            pass.

A player’s ability to catch or make a
                    play on the disc is not considered to be
                    “affected” because that player stopped, slowed
                    down, or otherwise ceased to continue playing because a call
                    was made by another player. Players are encouraged to make
                    every effort to continue playing until play actually stops.
                    [[When a player determines whether an infraction
                        affected the play (17.C.5), this
                        is very important to recognize.]]



An infraction may only be called by a
                    player on the infracted team who recognizes that it has
                    occurred, unless specified differently elsewhere.
                    [[The player must know that a specific rule was
                        violated and have perceived the particular action with
                        certainty. A player may not call an infraction whenever
                        the player maybe recognizes that some infraction might
                        have occurred.]]
                    The player must immediately call “violation” or
                    the name of the specific infraction loudly.
                
A player called for an infraction may
                    contest that call if that player believes the infraction did
                    not occur.
                    [[This belief may be based on the player’s
                        perspective on the particular sequence of events or
                        based on a disagreement over the application of the
                        rules, provided the player has read and understands the
                        rules. For example, “No, I didn’t slap your
                        hand” or “Tipping the disc to someone else
                        is not a travel.”]]

Any time an infraction is called, the
                    Continuation Rule applies. Continuation Rule: Play stops
                    when the thrower in possession acknowledges that an
                    infraction has been called.
                    [[This refers to the thrower who possesses the disc or
                        has just released the disc at the time of the
                        infraction/call. Who the thrower (3.O.5) is is determined at the time of the
                        infraction/call.]]
                    If a call is made when the disc is in the air or the thrower
                    is in the act of throwing, or if the thrower fails to
                    acknowledge the call and subsequently attempts a pass, play
                    continues until the outcome of that pass is determined. For
                    the purpose of the Continuation Rule, an uncontested stall
                    that occurs after another call is treated the same as an
                    incomplete pass.
                    [[Thus, if you get stalled before you acknowledge a
                        call, it is treated the same as if you ignored the call
                        and threw a turnover.]]
                    Play then either stops or continues according to the
                    following:
                    

Despite any outcome dictated by
                            these rules, if the involved players on both teams
                            agree that the infraction did not affect the outcome
                            of the play, play stops and the result of the play
                            stands. This provision does not apply if the thrower
                            is aware an infraction has been called and
                            subsequently attempts a pass.
                        

Where the outcome of these rules
                            is for play to continue unhalted, the player who
                            called the infraction must announce “play
                            on.” Additionally, any player recognizing that
                            play should continue without stoppage should
                            announce “play on.” If the player who
                            called the infraction does not announce “play
                            on” and the opposing team is uncertain whether
                            play should continue, the opposing team has the
                            option to stop play by calling
                            “violation.”
                        

For calls made by the offense:
                            

If the pass is
                                    complete:
                                    

If the
                                            offense called the infraction before
                                            the thrower began the act of
                                            throwing (3.O.3), play stops and possession
                                            reverts to the thrower.
                                        

If the
                                            offense called the infraction after
                                            the thrower began the act of
                                            throwing, play continues unhalted.
                                        

Where an
                                            infraction is called by the thrower,
                                            players should treat the call as if
                                            it was made when the infraction
                                            occurred in determining whether the
                                            call was made before or after the
                                            thrower was in the act of throwing.
                                            If the infraction occurred after the
                                            throw was released, the call is
                                            considered to have been made by a
                                            non-thrower.
                                            [[This means that if you throw
                                                a turnover and call a foul on
                                                contact after the release, the
                                                turnover will generally stand.
                                                Note that the timing is based on
                                                when the infraction occurred for
                                                this rule.]]




If the pass is

If the
                                            infraction affected the play (17.C.5), play stops and the disc reverts

                                            rule (e.g., the receiving foul rule)
                                            says otherwise.

                                            stands.
                                        





For calls made by the defense:
                            

If the pass is
                                    complete:
                                    

If the
                                            infraction affected the play (17.C.5), play stops and the disc reverts
                                            to the thrower unless the specific
                                            rule (e.g., the receiving foul rule)
                                            says otherwise.
                                        

If the
                                            infraction did not affect the play,
                                            play stops and the result of the
                                            play stands.
                                        



If the pass is
                                    incomplete, play continues un-halted.
                                



An infraction affected the play
                            if an infracted player determines that the outcome
                            of the specific play, from the time of the
                            infraction until play stops, may have been
                            meaningfully different absent the infraction.
                            [[It is the infracted player’s
                                responsibility to announce if play was affected.
                                For example, if a defender calls
                                “pick” while trailing a receiver by
                                6 feet, the defender should indicate whether the
                                pick affected the play. If the pick did not
                                affect the play, the defender will still recover
                                any distance lost, but the
                                completed pass
                                will stand. If the pick did affect the play, the
                                disc reverts to the thrower.]]
                            For example, if a receiver is fouled and thereby
                            prevented from getting open for a pass, the play was
                            affected; however, if the receiver would not have
                            received a pass even without the foul, the play was
                            not affected.
                            [[Contact that occurs after the outcome of the
                                play is determined cannot affect the play. For
                                example, if a defender catches a disc before
                                lightly bumping into the receiver, that contact
                                did not affect the play and the turnover will
                                stand.]]


Positioning after a call:
                            

If no pass is thrown or
                                    attempted before the thrower stops play by
                                    acknowledging the call, all players return
                                    to the locations they occupied when the call
                                    was made.
                                

If a pass is thrown or

                                    the call or the call is made after the
                                    throwing attempt, and
                                    

if possession
                                            reverts to the thrower, all players
                                            return to the locations they
                                            occupied at the earlier of:

                                                receiving foul, the players will
                                                return to where they were at the
                                                time of the throw (rather than
                                                remaining downfield after
                                                chasing down the disc).]]


the
                                                    time of the throw,
                                                

the
                                                    time of the call.
                                                



if a player
                                            other than the thrower is awarded
                                            possession due to an uncontested
                                            call, all players return to the
                                            locations they occupied at the time
                                            of the infraction.
                                        

if the result
                                            of a play stands, players return to
                                            the locations they occupied when
                                            play stopped.
                                        






Despite any outcome dictated by
                            these rules, if the involved players on both teams
                            agree that the infraction did not affect the outcome
                            of the play, play stops and the result of the play
                            stands. This provision does not apply if the thrower
                            is aware an infraction has been called and
                            subsequently attempts a pass.
                        
Where the outcome of these rules
                            is for play to continue unhalted, the player who
                            called the infraction must announce “play
                            on.” Additionally, any player recognizing that
                            play should continue without stoppage should
                            announce “play on.” If the player who
                            called the infraction does not announce “play
                            on” and the opposing team is uncertain whether
                            play should continue, the opposing team has the
                            option to stop play by calling
                            “violation.”
                        
For calls made by the offense:
                            

If the pass is
                                    complete:
                                    

If the
                                            offense called the infraction before
                                            the thrower began the act of
                                            throwing (3.O.3), play stops and possession
                                            reverts to the thrower.
                                        

If the
                                            offense called the infraction after
                                            the thrower began the act of
                                            throwing, play continues unhalted.
                                        

Where an
                                            infraction is called by the thrower,
                                            players should treat the call as if
                                            it was made when the infraction
                                            occurred in determining whether the
                                            call was made before or after the
                                            thrower was in the act of throwing.
                                            If the infraction occurred after the
                                            throw was released, the call is
                                            considered to have been made by a
                                            non-thrower.
                                            [[This means that if you throw

                                                turnover will generally stand.

Where an

                                            players should treat the call as if
                                            it was made when the infraction
                                            occurred in determining whether the
                                            call was made before or after the
                                            thrower was in the act of throwing.
                                            If the infraction occurred after the
                                            throw was released, the call is
                                            considered to have been made by a
                                            non-thrower.

An infraction affected the play
                            if an infracted player determines that the outcome
                            of the specific play, from the time of the
                            infraction until play stops, may have been
                            meaningfully different absent the infraction.
                            [[It is the infracted player’s
                                responsibility to announce if play was affected.
                                For example, if a defender calls
                                “pick” while trailing a receiver by
                                6 feet, the defender should indicate whether the
                                pick affected the play. If the pick did not
                                affect the play, the defender will still recover
                                any distance lost, but the
                                completed pass
                                will stand. If the pick did affect the play, the
                                disc reverts to the thrower.]]
                            For example, if a receiver is fouled and thereby
                            prevented from getting open for a pass, the play was
                            affected; however, if the receiver would not have
                            received a pass even without the foul, the play was
                            not affected.
                            [[Contact that occurs after the outcome of the
                                play is determined cannot affect the play. For
                                example, if a defender catches a disc before
                                lightly bumping into the receiver, that contact
                                did not affect the play and the turnover will
                                stand.]]

                                            of the infraction.
                                        
if the result
                                            of a play stands, players return to
                                            the locations they occupied when
                                            play stopped.
                                        
If a player makes a play-halting call and
                    subsequently determines that their call was incorrect, they
                    should retract the call by announcing
                    “retracted.” Play still stops. Play restarts
                    with a check and the stall resumes according to
                    15.A.5.a.
                    [[This includes a player incorrectly stopping play
                        because they thought they heard a call such as “pick”
                        and echoed the call.]]

If a dispute arises concerning an
                    infraction or the outcome of a play (e.g., a catch where no
                    one had a good perspective), and the teams cannot come to a
                    satisfactory resolution, play stops, and the disc is
                    returned to the thrower and put into play with a check (9.D), with the count reached plus one or at six if over five.
                
Any player may stop a rolling or sliding
                    disc, but advancing it in any direction is a violation.
                
If an infraction results in possession
                    reverting to a thrower who was airborne when releasing the
                    disc, play restarts at the spot on the playing field closest
                    to the point of release.
                    [[This applies to throwers attempting a
                        “greatest” or any other airborne
                        thrower.]]

If multiple infractions occur on the same
                    play or before play stops, the outcomes should be resolved
                    in reverse sequence (latest infraction first, earliest
                    infraction last).
                    

If an earlier infraction is
                            determined not to have affected the play (17.C.1
                            and 17.C.5), that infraction
                            is not resolved and it does not affect the
                            resolution of subsequent infractions.
                            [[Not resolved essentially means that the call
                                is treated as if it had not occurred and the
                                result of the play (possession, stall count,
                                etc.) is unchanged by that call.]]


Offsetting infractions: If both
                            offensive and defensive infractions occur
                            simultaneously or the sequence cannot be determined,
                            the resolution for this set of infractions is: the
                            disc is returned to the thrower and put into play
                            with a check, with the count reached plus one or at
                            six if over five.
                            [[It is possible that resolutions to earlier
                                infractions may ultimately change this
                                particular outcome.]]


Exception: If separate
                            fouls
                            occur while the disc is in the air, but before any
                            player starts to attempt to catch or block the disc,
                            those
                            fouls
                            are treated as simultaneous and on the same play.
                        

[[Examples: 


                                A receiver and their opponent contact each other
                                and both call fouls against the other.
                                17.H.2 applies, and the
                                disc is returned to the thrower and put into
                                play with a check, with the count reached plus
                                one or at six if over five.
                            

                                Two different receiver-opponent pairs call fouls
                                — one against the offense and one against
                                the defense — while the disc is in the
                                air, but before anyone starts trying to catch
                                it. 17.H.3 applies in this
                                case, even if the fouls occur several seconds
                                apart. The disc is returned to the thrower and
                                put into play with a check, with the count
                                reached plus one or at six if over five.
                            

                                The
                                marker
                                calls an offensive foul on the thrower during
                                the throw, then later a receiver calls a
                                defensive foul on a defender during the
                                reception on an incomplete pass. The fouls are
                                resolved in reverse sequence. First, the
                                receiving foul is resolved (here, assumed
                                uncontested), granting possession to the
                                offensive receiver, then the throwing foul is
                                resolved (here, assumed uncontested), returning
                                the disc to the thrower with the count reached
                                plus one (max nine). The earlier infraction
                                (offensive foul on the thrower) takes precedence
                                over the later infraction (defensive foul on the
                                receiver), resulting in the disc returning to
                                the original thrower.]]
                            



If an earlier infraction is
                            determined not to have affected the play (17.C.1
                            and 17.C.5), that infraction
                            is not resolved and it does not affect the
                            resolution of subsequent infractions.

                                it. 17.H.3 applies in this
                                case, even if the fouls occur several seconds
                                apart. The disc is returned to the thrower and

                            or posing a significant risk of injury to fellow
                            players, or other dangerously aggressive behavior
                            are considered “dangerous play” and are
                            treated as a
                            foul. The proper call in such circumstances is
                            “dangerous play” and play stops. This
                            rule is not superseded by any other rule.
                            [[The following are non-exhaustive examples of
                                dangerous play:
                                

                                        significantly colliding with a mostly
                                        stationary opponent,
                                    

                                        jumping into a group of mostly
                                        stationary players,
                                    

                                        diving around or through a player that
                                        results in contact with a player’s
                                        back or legs,
                                    

                                        running without looking when there is a
                                        likelihood of other players occupying
                                        the space into which the player is
                                        traveling,
                                    

                                        jumping or otherwise leaving the ground
                                        where it is likely that a significant
                                        collision will result,
                                    

                                        wild or uncontrolled throwing motions,
                                    

                                        initiating contact with a player’s
                                        head,
                                    

                                        initiating contact with an airborne
                                        player’s lower body that prevents
                                        them from landing on their feet, and
                                    

                                        jumping right in front of a sprinting
                                        player in a manner where contact is
                                        unavoidable]]
                                    



Dangerous play is
                                    considered a foul regardless of whether or
                                    when the disc arrives or contact occurs.
                                    

The vast
                                            majority of dangerous play will
                                            involve contact between players.
                                            However, contact is not required for
                                            a player to invoke this rule where
                                            there is reasonable certainty that
                                            contact would have occurred had the
                                            player not taken steps to avoid
                                            contact.
                                            [[A player is not required to
                                                hold their position and receive
                                                contact in order to call
                                                “dangerous play,”
                                                but the mere possibility of
                                                contact is insufficient to
                                                justify a call. Furthermore, if
                                                the offending player stops or
                                                changes their path such that
                                                contact would not have occurred,
                                                contact was not
                                                “reasonably
                                                certain.”]]




Resolution. If
                                    uncontested, a call of “dangerous
                                    play” is resolved as an analogous foul
                                    (e.g., if the call occurred while or
                                    immediately after the calling player was
                                    making a play on a disc in the air, it is
                                    treated as a Receiving Foul (17.I.4.b)). A player called for dangerous play may
                                    contest the call if they believe the call
                                    was incorrect (17.B).
                                    

Dangerous
                                            play between a thrower and
                                            marker
                                            is treated as a throwing foul that
                                            affected the play, regardless of
                                            whether or when the disc is released
                                            or when contact occurs, unless the
                                            calling player determines otherwise.
                                        

Dangerous
                                            play occurring when or immediately
                                            after the disc is in the air is
                                            treated as a receiving foul if
                                            either player involved is attempting
                                            a play on the disc. However, the
                                            calling player may elect to treat
                                            the dangerous play as a general
                                            foul, if the player determines that
                                            the dangerous play was unrelated to
                                            the overall play that decided the
                                            outcome of the action.
                                            [[For example, if a third
                                                player appears and grabs the
                                                disc far before it reaches the
                                                two involved players, or if the
                                                disc is thrown to the opposite
                                                side of the field, the involved
                                                players will not be attempting a
                                                play on the disc. However, if
                                                multiple players accumulate
                                                under a floating disc, one
                                                player’s dangerous play
                                                will be treated as a receiving
                                                foul, even if a third player
                                                happens to make a successful
                                                play on the disc, as the players
                                                under the disc were attempting a
                                                play on the disc. The calling
                                                player would have discretion to
                                                deem the third player’s
                                                play so independent and removed
                                                from the involved players that
                                                the calling player wishes to
                                                treat the dangerous play as a
                                                general foul rather than a
                                                receiving foul. In general, a
                                                calling player’s decision
                                                that a dangerous play was
                                                unrelated to the overall play
                                                will be based on the dangerous
                                                play being removed in
                                                significant distance or time
                                                from the overall play. By way of
                                                further example, even a
                                                dangerous play committed against
                                                a player unaware of the
                                                approaching disc will be treated
                                                as a receiving foul, where the
                                                offending player was attempting
                                                to make a play on the disc,
                                                giving the benefit of the doubt
                                                that the calling player could
                                                potentially have become aware of
                                                the approaching disc, had the
                                                offending player made a safe
                                                play. In this instance, the
                                                calling player could determine
                                                that it would not have been
                                                possible to become aware of the
                                                disc such that the outcome of
                                                the play would have changed and
                                                therefore elect to treat the

Dangerous
                                            play is treated as a general foul
                                            only if it occurs when the disc is
                                            not in the air, occurs far away from
                                            the disc, when the disc is obviously
                                            uncatchable, or when the calling
                                            player has elected such treatment
                                            under
                                            17.I.1.b.2. In this situation, the calling
                                            player determines whether the play
                                            was affected, under the standard
                                            enunciated in this rule and its
                                            annotations.

                                            marker
                                            may contest the
                                            “contact” call by

                                            which stops play. If the thrower

                                            is treated as if the thrower called

Receiving Fouls:

                                            to make a play on the disc, that
                                            player has committed a receiving
                                            foul. Some amount of
                                            incidental contact
                                            before, during, or immediately after
                                            the attempt often is unavoidable and
                                            is not a foul.
                                            [[The opponent must at least
                                                begin an attempt to make a play
                                                on the disc. The
                                                opponent’s “attempt

If
                                            17.C.3.b.1
                                            of the Continuation Rule applies: if
                                            the call is uncontested, the fouled
                                            player gains possession at the spot
                                            on the playing field closest to the
                                            spot of the infraction. If the foul
                                            is contested, the disc reverts to
                                            the thrower.
                                        

The Principle
                                            of Verticality: All players have the
                                            right to enter the air space
                                            immediately above their torso to
                                            make a play on a thrown disc. If
                                            non-incidental contact
                                            occurs in the airspace immediately
                                            above a player before the outcome of
                                            the play is determined (e.g., before
                                            possession is gained or an
                                            incomplete pass is effected), it is
                                            a foul on the player entering the
                                            vertical space of the other player.
                                            [[If the disc is caught (or
                                                rendered uncatchable) before
                                                contact occurs, then the outcome
                                                of the play is determined
                                                already and the contact is not
                                                an infraction of this
                                                rule.]]


Force-out
                                            Foul: If an airborne player catches
                                            the disc and is contacted by an
                                            opposing player before landing, and
                                            that contact causes the player to
                                            land out-of-bounds instead of
                                            in-bounds, or out of the end zone
                                            instead of in the end zone, it is a
                                            foul on the opposing player and the
                                            fouled player retains possession at
                                            the spot of the foul. If an
                                            uncontested force-out foul results
                                            in an in-bounds player landing
                                            outside the end zone being attacked
                                            when they would have landed in the
                                            end zone without the foul, a goal is
                                            awarded.
                                        



Blocking Fouls:
                                    

When the disc
                                            is in the air a player may not move
                                            in a manner solely to prevent an
                                            opponent from taking an unoccupied
                                            path to the disc and any resulting
                                            non-incidental contact
                                            is a foul on the blocking player
                                            which is treated like a receiving
                                            foul (17.I.4.b).
                                            [[Solely. The intent of the
                                                player’s movement can be
                                                partly motivated to prevent an
                                                opponent from taking an
                                                unoccupied path to the disc, so
                                                long as it is part of a general
                                                effort to make a play on the
                                                disc. Note, if a trailing player
                                                runs into a player in front of
                                                them, it is nearly always a foul
                                                on the trailing player.]]


A player may
                                            not take a position that is
                                            unavoidable by a moving opponent
                                            when time, distance, and line of
                                            sight are considered.

[[Sustained contact with, and control

Dangerous Play. Actions
                            demonstrating reckless disregard for the safety of
                            or posing a significant risk of injury to fellow
                            players, or other dangerously aggressive behavior

                            treated as a
                            foul. The proper call in such circumstances is
                            “dangerous play” and play stops. This
                            rule is not superseded by any other rule.

Dangerous play is
                                    considered a foul regardless of whether or
                                    when the disc arrives or contact occurs.
                                    

The vast
                                            majority of dangerous play will
                                            involve contact between players.
                                            However, contact is not required for
                                            a player to invoke this rule where
                                            there is reasonable certainty that
                                            contact would have occurred had the
                                            player not taken steps to avoid
                                            contact.
                                            [[A player is not required to
                                                hold their position and receive
                                                contact in order to call
                                                “dangerous play,”
                                                but the mere possibility of
                                                contact is insufficient to
                                                justify a call. Furthermore, if
                                                the offending player stops or
                                                changes their path such that
                                                contact would not have occurred,
                                                contact was not
                                                “reasonably
                                                certain.”]]




Resolution. If
                                    uncontested, a call of “dangerous
                                    play” is resolved as an analogous foul
                                    (e.g., if the call occurred while or
                                    immediately after the calling player was
                                    making a play on a disc in the air, it is
                                    treated as a Receiving Foul (17.I.4.b)). A player called for dangerous play may
                                    contest the call if they believe the call
                                    was incorrect (17.B).
                                    

Dangerous

                                            affected the play, regardless of
                                            whether or when the disc is released
                                            or when contact occurs, unless the
                                            calling player determines otherwise.
                                        

Dangerous

                                            after the disc is in the air is
                                            treated as a receiving foul if
                                            either player involved is attempting
                                            a play on the disc. However, the
                                            calling player may elect to treat
                                            the dangerous play as a general
                                            foul, if the player determines that
                                            the dangerous play was unrelated to
                                            the overall play that decided the
                                            outcome of the action.

                                                play on the disc. The calling

Dangerous

Resolution. If

                                    immediately after the calling player was
                                    making a play on a disc in the air, it is

Receiving Fouls:

                                            to make a play on the disc, that
                                            player has committed a receiving
                                            foul. Some amount of
                                            incidental contact

                                            the attempt often is unavoidable and
                                            is not a foul.
                                            [[The opponent must at least
                                                begin an attempt to make a play

If

                                            of the Continuation Rule applies: if
                                            the call is uncontested, the fouled
                                            player gains possession at the spot
                                            on the playing field closest to the
                                            spot of the infraction. If the foul
                                            is contested, the disc reverts to
                                            the thrower.
                                        

The Principle
                                            of Verticality: All players have the
                                            right to enter the air space
                                            immediately above their torso to
                                            make a play on a thrown disc. If
                                            non-incidental contact
                                            occurs in the airspace immediately

                                            the play is determined (e.g., before
                                            possession is gained or an
                                            incomplete pass is effected), it is
                                            a foul on the player entering the
                                            vertical space of the other player.
                                            [[If the disc is caught (or
                                                rendered uncatchable) before
                                                contact occurs, then the outcome
                                                of the play is determined
                                                already and the contact is not
                                                an infraction of this
                                                rule.]]


Force-out
                                            Foul: If an airborne player catches
                                            the disc and is contacted by an
                                            opposing player before landing, and
                                            that contact causes the player to
                                            land out-of-bounds instead of
                                            in-bounds, or out of the end zone
                                            instead of in the end zone, it is a
                                            foul on the opposing player and the
                                            fouled player retains possession at
                                            the spot of the foul. If an
                                            uncontested force-out foul results
                                            in an in-bounds player landing
                                            outside the end zone being attacked
                                            when they would have landed in the
                                            end zone without the foul, a goal is
                                            awarded.
                                        



Blocking Fouls:
                                    

When the disc
                                            is in the air a player may not move
                                            in a manner solely to prevent an
                                            opponent from taking an unoccupied
                                            path to the disc and any resulting
                                            non-incidental contact
                                            is a foul on the blocking player
                                            which is treated like a receiving
                                            foul (17.I.4.b).
                                            [[Solely. The intent of the

                                                unoccupied path to the disc, so

                                                effort to make a play on the
                                                disc. Note, if a trailing player
                                                runs into a player in front of
                                                them, it is nearly always a foul
                                                on the trailing player.]]


A player may
                                            not take a position that is
                                            unavoidable by a moving opponent
                                            when time, distance, and line of
                                            sight are considered.

                                            to make a play on the disc, that

                                            is not a foul.
                                            [[The opponent must at least

If
                                            17.C.3.b.1
                                            of the Continuation Rule applies: if
                                            the call is uncontested, the fouled
                                            player gains possession at the spot
                                            on the playing field closest to the
                                            spot of the infraction. If the foul
                                            is contested, the disc reverts to
                                            the thrower.
                                        

The Principle
                                            of Verticality: All players have the
                                            right to enter the air space
                                            immediately above their torso to
                                            make a play on a thrown disc. If
                                            non-incidental contact
                                            occurs in the airspace immediately
                                            above a player before the outcome of
                                            the play is determined (e.g., before
                                            possession is gained or an
                                            incomplete pass is effected), it is
                                            a foul on the player entering the
                                            vertical space of the other player.
                                            [[If the disc is caught (or
                                                rendered uncatchable) before
                                                contact occurs, then the outcome
                                                of the play is determined
                                                already and the contact is not
                                                an infraction of this
                                                rule.]]


Force-out
                                            Foul: If an airborne player catches
                                            the disc and is contacted by an
                                            opposing player before landing, and
                                            that contact causes the player to
                                            land out-of-bounds instead of
                                            in-bounds, or out of the end zone
                                            instead of in the end zone, it is a
                                            foul on the opposing player and the
                                            fouled player retains possession at
                                            the spot of the foul. If an
                                            uncontested force-out foul results
                                            in an in-bounds player landing
                                            outside the end zone being attacked
                                            when they would have landed in the
                                            end zone without the foul, a goal is
                                            awarded.
                                        


If a player
                                            contacts an opponent while the disc

If

                                            of the Continuation Rule applies: if
                                            the call is uncontested, the fouled
                                            player gains possession at the spot
                                            on the playing field closest to the
                                            spot of the infraction. If the foul
                                            is contested, the disc reverts to
                                            the thrower.
                                        
The Principle
                                            of Verticality: All players have the
                                            right to enter the air space
                                            immediately above their torso to
                                            make a play on a thrown disc. If
                                            non-incidental contact
                                            occurs in the airspace immediately

                                            possession is gained or an
                                            incomplete pass is effected), it is
                                            a foul on the player entering the
                                            vertical space of the other player.
                                            [[If the disc is caught (or
                                                rendered uncatchable) before
                                                contact occurs, then the outcome
                                                of the play is determined

Force-out
                                            Foul: If an airborne player catches
                                            the disc and is contacted by an
                                            opposing player before landing, and
                                            that contact causes the player to
                                            land out-of-bounds instead of
                                            in-bounds, or out of the end zone
                                            instead of in the end zone, it is a
                                            foul on the opposing player and the
                                            fouled player retains possession at
                                            the spot of the foul. If an
                                            uncontested force-out foul results
                                            in an in-bounds player landing
                                            outside the end zone being attacked
                                            when they would have landed in the
                                            end zone without the foul, a goal is
                                            awarded.

Picks:

                            moves in a manner that causes a

                            to be obstructed by another player. Obstruction may
                            result from contact with, or the need to avoid, the

A pick occurs whenever an
                            offensive player
                            moves in a manner that causes a

                            offensive player
                            to be obstructed by another player. Obstruction may
                            result from contact with, or the need to avoid, the
                            obstructing player.
                        
A pick can be called only by the
                            obstructed player and must be announced by loudly
                            calling “pick” immediately after it

Traveling: The thrower must establish and
                    continually maintain a
                    pivot
                    at the appropriate spot on the field until the throw is
                    released. Failure to do so is a travel and is resolved
                    according to 17.K.3, below.
                    [[Resolved according to
                        17.K.3 only if the travel is
                        called, otherwise play continues uninterrupted.]]


In addition, each of the
                            following is a travel:
                            

A player catches the
                                    disc and either speeds up, changes direction
                                    or does not stop as quickly as possible
                                    before establishing a
                                    pivot
                                    (16.B).
                                

A player receives a
                                    pass while running or jumping, and releases
                                    a pass after the third additional
                                    ground contact
                                    and before establishing a
                                    pivot
                                    (16.C).
                                

Purposeful bobbling
                                    (including tipping, delaying, guiding,
                                    brushing, or the like) to oneself in order
                                    to advance the disc in any direction from
                                    where it initially was contacted (16.A).
                                    

If a defender
                                            commits this infraction and the
                                            result of the play is a turnover,
                                            the defender retains possession at
                                            the initial spot of the travel.
                                        



The thrower fails to
                                    touch the disc to the ground when required
                                    (14.B).
                                



Exceptions:
                            

If a non-standing
                                    player loses contact with the
                                    pivot
                                    spot in order to stand up, it is not a
                                    travel, provided the new pivot is
                                    established at the same location.
                                

It is not a travel if a
                                    player catches the disc and releases a pass
                                    before three additional points of
                                    ground contact
                                    (16.C).
                                

If play stops, the
                                    thrower may reset the
                                    pivot.
                                



Resolutions:
                            

If the travel occurs
                                    and a pass is thrown:
                                    

If the pass
                                            is incomplete, play continues
                                            uninterrupted (as per the
                                            Continuation Rule,
                                            17.C.4.b).
                                        

If the pass
                                            is complete, play stops and the disc
                                            is returned to the thrower where the
                                            travel occurred (as per the
                                            Continuation Rule,
                                            17.C.4.a.1). Play restarts with a check.

                                                occured is the spot on the field

                                                pivot
                                                would have been had they not
                                                traveled.]]
[[If the thrower threw from
                                                either the end zone or

                                                appropriate spot, the following
                                                procedure is used instead:
                                                First, the disc is checked in
                                                where the thrower threw the
                                                pass, making it
                                                live, then the thrower walks to the
                                                appropriate spot for their
                                                pivot
                                                and puts the disc
                                                in play. At this point, the stall
                                                count may resume.]]




If the travel occurs
                                    and no pass has been attempted:
                                    

Play does not
                                            stop. The defense (typically the
                                            marker) points to the spot where the
                                            travel occurred, and the thrower
                                            returns to that spot without delay.
                                            The thrower must touch the disc to
                                            the ground before attempting a legal
                                            pass.
                                            [[Play does not stop, but the
                                                disc is

                                            The thrower must touch the disc to

A player’s ability to catch or make a
                    play on the disc is not considered to be
                    “affected” because that player stopped, slowed
                    down, or otherwise ceased to continue playing because a call
                    was made by another player. Players are encouraged to make
                    every effort to continue playing until play actually stops.
                    [[When a player determines whether an infraction
                        affected the play (17.C.5), this
                        is very important to recognize.]]

Positioning
            

Each player is entitled to occupy any
                    position on the field not occupied by an opposing player,
                    unless specifically overridden elsewhere, provided that no
                    personal contact is caused in taking such a position.
                

A player who jumps is entitled to land at
                    the take-off spot without hindrance by opponents. That
                    player also is entitled to land at another spot, provided
                    that the landing spot, and the direct path between the
                    take-off and landing spots, were not already occupied at the
                    time of take-off.
                    [[This does not trump a player’s responsibility
                        to make reasonable efforts to avoid contact and to not
                        commit a blocking foul. If you commit a blocking foul,
                        the fact that you jumped to the spot instead of running
                        does not negate the foul.]]

                        Observers
                        should accept this declination. However, if teams
                        mutually agree to ignore the sideline technicals and
                        players are willfully not maintaining proper safety
                        buffers, this would be an example of when an observer
                        should not allow the declining of the yardage penalty.
                        Proper communication between
                        observers
                        and teams should alleviate any concerns.]]

Etiquette
            

If an infraction is committed and not
                    called, the player committing the infraction should inform
                    the infracted player or team of the infraction.
                

It is the responsibility of all players to
                    avoid any delay when starting, restarting, or continuing
                    play. This includes standing over the disc or taking more
                    time than reasonably necessary to put the disc into play.
                    [[This includes standing back from the disc, wandering
                        around to gain more time, etc. Pretending not to delay
                        while delaying is still delaying.]]


On a
                    stoppage of play, if it is ever unclear which of a team’s members are
                    the current players or where they are on or off the field,
                    they should identify themselves when the opposing team
                    requests.
                

If a dispute arises on the field, play
                    stops and is restarted with a check when the matter is
                    resolved.
                

If a novice player commits an infraction
                    out of sincere ignorance of the rules, it should be common
                    practice to stop play and explain the infraction.
                

When a call is made, throwers must stop
                    play by visibly or audibly communicating the stoppage as
                    soon as they are aware of the call and all players should
                    echo calls on the field.
                    [[If the
                        marker
                        has made reasonable efforts to notify the thrower of a
                        call and believes that the thrower has not stopped play
                        promptly enough, the
                        marker
                        may call a violation under this rule and a
                        completed pass
                        will come back to the thrower (17.C.4.a.1).]]


In addition to the assumption that players
                    will not intentionally violate the rules, players are
                    similarly expected to make every effort to avoid violating
                    them.
                


If an infraction is committed and not
                    called, the player committing the infraction should inform
                    the infracted player or team of the infraction.
                
It is the responsibility of all players to
                    avoid any delay when starting, restarting, or continuing
                    play. This includes standing over the disc or taking more
                    time than reasonably necessary to put the disc into play.
                    [[This includes standing back from the disc, wandering
                        around to gain more time, etc. Pretending not to delay
                        while delaying is still delaying.]]

On a
                    stoppage of play, if it is ever unclear which of a team’s members are

                    they should identify themselves when the opposing team

Components of the Misconduct System

                    

Technical Foul
                            

A Technical Foul can be
                                    assessed against a team for minor conduct
                                    violations that do not affect the
                                    competitiveness of the game.
                                

The first two Technical
                                    Fouls issued to a team are warnings with no
                                    associated penalty.
                                

A third or subsequent
                                    Technical Fouls for a team in a single game
                                    results in a Misconduct Penalty against that
                                    team.
                                

There is no limit to the
                                    number of Technical Fouls or Misconduct
                                    Penalties a team can accrue during a game.
                                

Technical Fouls do not
                                    carry over beyond the game in which they are
                                    issued.
                                



Team Misconduct Foul (Blue Card)
                            

A Team Misconduct Foul
                                    (TMF) can be assessed against a team for
                                    conduct that violates Spirit of the Game by
                                    any
                                    team member
                                    or spectators considered as partisans for
                                    the team.
                                

The TMF can be assessed
                                    regardless of whether the infracted team
                                    makes any call, although teams are
                                    encouraged to make violation calls in order
                                    to directly communicate about issues and
                                    minimize the need for
                                    observers
                                    to issue TMFs without a call.
                                

The first two TMFs issued
                                    to a team are warnings with no associated
                                    penalty.
                                

A third or subsequent TMF
                                    for a team in a single game results in a
                                    Misconduct Penalty against that team.
                                

There is no limit to the
                                    number of TMFs or Misconduct Penalties a
                                    team can accrue during a game.
                                

TMFs do not carry over
                                    beyond the game in which they are issued.
                                



Personal Misconduct Foul (Yellow
                            Card)
                            

A Personal Misconduct
                                    Foul (PMF) can be assessed against a
                                    specific
                                    team member
                                    for particularly egregious conduct or a
                                    pattern of such behavior.
                                

A PMF is a formal warning
                                    for unacceptable behavior and puts the team
                                    member on notice that any further such
                                    actions will result in ejection from the
                                    game.
                                

A
                                    team member
                                    who receives a second PMF during a single
                                    game is ejected for the remainder of that
                                    game. If this occurs in the second half of
                                    the game, the ejection remains in effect for
                                    the first half of the team’s next
                                    game.
                                

A
                                    team member
                                    who receives three PMFs during a tournament
                                    is suspended for the remainder of the
                                    tournament.
                                

Assessment of a PMF is
                                    non-reviewable for the duration of the game,
                                    although it may be appealed to the ADA after
                                    the game.
                                

One TMF is automatically
                                    assessed against a team whenever one of its
                                    members receives a PMF.
                                



Ejection (Red Card)
                            

A
                                    team member
                                    may be ejected from a game for particularly
                                    egregious conduct.
                                

No formal or informal
                                    warning is necessary before a
                                    team member
                                    is ejected, and an ejection need not be
                                    preceded by a TMF or PMF.
                                

If an ejection occurs
                                    during the second half of the game, the
                                    ejection remains in effect for the first
                                    half of the
                                    team member’s
                                    team’s next game.
                                

If a
                                    team member
                                    receives more than one ejection in a
                                    tournament, that
                                    team member
                                    is suspended for the rest of the tournament,
                                    and a formal complaint may be filed with
                                    USAU.
                                

An ejection is
                                    non-reviewable for the duration of the game,
                                    although it may be appealed to the ADA after
                                    the game.
                                

One TMF is automatically
                                    assessed against a team whenever one of its
                                    members
                                    is ejected.
                                



Game Forfeiture
                            

If five PMFs are assessed
                                    against
                                    team members
                                    on a single team during a game, that team
                                    forfeits the game. For this purpose, an
                                    ejection is equivalent to two PMFs. For
                                    example, if three or more players on a
                                    single team are ejected, that team forfeits
                                    the game.
                                

If the situation arises
                                    where both teams would be required to
                                    forfeit the game due to multiple player
                                    ejections, the ADA determines the
                                    appropriate outcome based on competition
                                    considerations.
                                




Technical Foul
                            

A Technical Foul can be
                                    assessed against a team for minor conduct
                                    violations that do not affect the
                                    competitiveness of the game.
                                

The first two Technical
                                    Fouls issued to a team are warnings with no
                                    associated penalty.
                                

A third or subsequent
                                    Technical Fouls for a team in a single game
                                    results in a Misconduct Penalty against that
                                    team.
                                

There is no limit to the
                                    number of Technical Fouls or Misconduct
                                    Penalties a team can accrue during a game.
                                

Technical Fouls do not
                                    carry over beyond the game in which they are
                                    issued.
                                


A Technical Foul can be
                                    assessed against a team for minor conduct
                                    violations that do not affect the
                                    competitiveness of the game.
                                
The first two Technical
                                    Fouls issued to a team are warnings with no
                                    associated penalty.
                                
A third or subsequent
                                    Technical Fouls for a team in a single game
                                    results in a Misconduct Penalty against that
                                    team.
                                
There is no limit to the
                                    number of Technical Fouls or Misconduct
                                    Penalties a team can accrue during a game.
                                
Technical Fouls do not
                                    carry over beyond the game in which they are
                                    issued.
                                
Team Misconduct Foul (Blue Card)
                            

A Team Misconduct Foul
                                    (TMF) can be assessed against a team for
                                    conduct that violates Spirit of the Game by
                                    any
                                    team member
                                    or spectators considered as partisans for
                                    the team.
                                

The TMF can be assessed
                                    regardless of whether the infracted team
                                    makes any call, although teams are
                                    encouraged to make violation calls in order
                                    to directly communicate about issues and
                                    minimize the need for
                                    observers
                                    to issue TMFs without a call.
                                

The first two TMFs issued
                                    to a team are warnings with no associated
                                    penalty.
                                

A third or subsequent TMF
                                    for a team in a single game results in a
                                    Misconduct Penalty against that team.
                                

There is no limit to the
                                    number of TMFs or Misconduct Penalties a
                                    team can accrue during a game.
                                

TMFs do not carry over
                                    beyond the game in which they are issued.
                                


A Team Misconduct Foul
                                    (TMF) can be assessed against a team for
                                    conduct that violates Spirit of the Game by
                                    any
                                    team member
                                    or spectators considered as partisans for
                                    the team.
                                
The TMF can be assessed
                                    regardless of whether the infracted team
                                    makes any call, although teams are
                                    encouraged to make violation calls in order
                                    to directly communicate about issues and
                                    minimize the need for
                                    observers
                                    to issue TMFs without a call.
                                
The first two TMFs issued
                                    to a team are warnings with no associated
                                    penalty.
                                
A third or subsequent TMF
                                    for a team in a single game results in a
                                    Misconduct Penalty against that team.
                                
There is no limit to the
                                    number of TMFs or Misconduct Penalties a
                                    team can accrue during a game.
                                
TMFs do not carry over
                                    beyond the game in which they are issued.
                                
Personal Misconduct Foul (Yellow
                            Card)
                            

A Personal Misconduct
                                    Foul (PMF) can be assessed against a
                                    specific
                                    team member
                                    for particularly egregious conduct or a
                                    pattern of such behavior.
                                

A PMF is a formal warning
                                    for unacceptable behavior and puts the team
                                    member on notice that any further such
                                    actions will result in ejection from the
                                    game.
                                

A
                                    team member
                                    who receives a second PMF during a single
                                    game is ejected for the remainder of that
                                    game. If this occurs in the second half of
                                    the game, the ejection remains in effect for
                                    the first half of the team’s next
                                    game.
                                

A
                                    team member
                                    who receives three PMFs during a tournament
                                    is suspended for the remainder of the
                                    tournament.
                                

Assessment of a PMF is
                                    non-reviewable for the duration of the game,
                                    although it may be appealed to the ADA after
                                    the game.
                                

One TMF is automatically
                                    assessed against a team whenever one of its
                                    members receives a PMF.
                                


A Personal Misconduct
                                    Foul (PMF) can be assessed against a

                                    for particularly egregious conduct or a
                                    pattern of such behavior.

A
                                    team member
                                    who receives three PMFs during a tournament
                                    is suspended for the remainder of the
                                    tournament.

Ejection (Red Card)
                            

A
                                    team member
                                    may be ejected from a game for particularly
                                    egregious conduct.
                                

No formal or informal
                                    warning is necessary before a
                                    team member
                                    is ejected, and an ejection need not be
                                    preceded by a TMF or PMF.
                                

If an ejection occurs
                                    during the second half of the game, the
                                    ejection remains in effect for the first
                                    half of the
                                    team member’s
                                    team’s next game.
                                

If a
                                    team member
                                    receives more than one ejection in a
                                    tournament, that

One TMF is automatically
                                    assessed against a team whenever one of its
                                    members
                                    is ejected.

                                    egregious conduct.

                                    team member
                                    receives more than one ejection in a
                                    tournament, that
                                    team member
                                    is suspended for the rest of the tournament,
                                    and a formal complaint may be filed with
                                    USAU.
                                
An ejection is
                                    non-reviewable for the duration of the game,
                                    although it may be appealed to the ADA after
                                    the game.
                                
One TMF is automatically
                                    assessed against a team whenever one of its
                                    members
                                    is ejected.
                                
Game Forfeiture
                            

If five PMFs are assessed
                                    against
                                    team members
                                    on a single team during a game, that team
                                    forfeits the game. For this purpose, an
                                    ejection is equivalent to two PMFs. For
                                    example, if three or more players on a
                                    single team are ejected, that team forfeits
                                    the game.
                                

If the situation arises
                                    where both teams would be required to
                                    forfeit the game due to multiple player
                                    ejections, the ADA determines the
                                    appropriate outcome based on competition
                                    considerations.
                                


If five PMFs are assessed
                                    against
                                    team members
                                    on a single team during a game, that team
                                    forfeits the game. For this purpose, an
                                    ejection is equivalent to two PMFs. For

Behavior Warranting Sanctions
                    

Poor Spirit
                            

                                    A TMF will be issued when a team
                                    demonstrates a pattern of poor spirit or
                                    disregard for the rules, by committing
                                    intentional, repeated, or flagrant
                                    infractions.
                                    

                                            If such a pattern is demonstrated by
                                            a single
                                            team member, a PMF will be issued to that
                                            team member.
                                        



                                    Behavior warranting such sanctions includes
                                    deliberate fouling, dangerous play,
                                    taunting, fighting, swearing directed at an
                                    official or opponent, repeated marking
                                    fouls, deliberate marking violations, making
                                    unwarranted calls or contests, or other
                                    blatant disregard of the rules.
                                

                                    Any flagrant foul does not require a pattern
                                    to result in a TMF or PMF.
                                

                                    A single particularly violent “harmful
                                    endangerment” infraction can be
                                    grounds for a PMF or an ejection, at the
                                    discretion of the observer who witnesses the
                                    incident.
                                

                                    A single particularly egregious
                                    demonstration of disregard for the rules,
                                    such as an intentional infraction or clearly
                                    unfounded call, can be grounds for a TMF.
                                



Battery
                            

Intentionally striking
                                    another person with a part of the body, a
                                    disc or anything else, or any clear attempt
                                    to do so, warrants an ejection. This
                                    includes, but is not limited to: punching or
                                    kicking, or attempting to punch or kick,
                                    someone; spiking, or attempting to spike, a
                                    disc on someone; and spitting on someone, or
                                    spitting at someone but missing.
                                    

If a
                                            team member
                                            spikes the disc without intending to
                                            hit another person, and it does hit
                                            an opposing
                                            team member, a TMF or PMF may be assessed at
                                            the discretion of the observer.
                                        





Swearing
                            

A TMF or PMF may be
                                    assessed for swearing if directed at an
                                    opposing
                                    team member, any spectator, or observer.
                                

Technical fouls will be
                                    issued for general, undirected swearing in
                                    accordance with any specific written
                                    guidelines for a given tournament.
                                



Deliberate Fouling
                            

A TMF or PMF may be
                                    assessed for a particularly hard, dangerous,
                                    or deliberate foul.
                                



Pushing/Shoving
                            

A TMF or PMF may be
                                    assessed for unwarranted aggressive (e.g.
                                    shoving) or dangerous (e.g. tripping)
                                    behavior.
                                



Taunting
                            

Repeated or prolonged
                                    taunting, or any verbal abuse of
                                    team members, fans, or USAU officials, warrants a TMF
                                    or PMF, depending on the severity of the
                                    offense.
                                



Sideline Encroachment
                            

                                    If, after being warned,
                                    team members
                                    continue to crowd the sideline, a Technical
                                    Foul may be issued.
                                

                                    If the
                                    team member’s
                                    encroachment interferes with play or an
                                    observer’s ability to make a call, a
                                    TMF should be issued.
                                



Any other behavior described by
                            Article X of the USAU Bylaws may warrant a TMF at
                            the discretion of the observer.
                        

Any behavior that would warrant the
                            issuance of a TMF, but which occurs in a game
                            without
                            observers, can result in sanctions upon a complaint filed to
                            the ADA.
                        


Poor Spirit
                            

                                    A TMF will be issued when a team
                                    demonstrates a pattern of poor spirit or
                                    disregard for the rules, by committing
                                    intentional, repeated, or flagrant
                                    infractions.
                                    

                                            If such a pattern is demonstrated by
                                            a single
                                            team member, a PMF will be issued to that
                                            team member.
                                        



                                    Behavior warranting such sanctions includes
                                    deliberate fouling, dangerous play,
                                    taunting, fighting, swearing directed at an
                                    official or opponent, repeated marking
                                    fouls, deliberate marking violations, making
                                    unwarranted calls or contests, or other
                                    blatant disregard of the rules.
                                

                                    Any flagrant foul does not require a pattern
                                    to result in a TMF or PMF.
                                

                                    A single particularly violent “harmful
                                    endangerment” infraction can be
                                    grounds for a PMF or an ejection, at the
                                    discretion of the observer who witnesses the
                                    incident.
                                

                                    A single particularly egregious
                                    demonstration of disregard for the rules,
                                    such as an intentional infraction or clearly
                                    unfounded call, can be grounds for a TMF.
                                


                                    A TMF will be issued when a team
                                    demonstrates a pattern of poor spirit or
                                    disregard for the rules, by committing
                                    intentional, repeated, or flagrant
                                    infractions.
                                    

                                            If such a pattern is demonstrated by
                                            a single
                                            team member, a PMF will be issued to that
                                            team member.
                                        


                                            If such a pattern is demonstrated by
                                            a single
                                            team member, a PMF will be issued to that
                                            team member.
                                        
                                    Behavior warranting such sanctions includes
                                    deliberate fouling, dangerous play,
                                    taunting, fighting, swearing directed at an
                                    official or opponent, repeated marking
                                    fouls, deliberate marking violations, making
                                    unwarranted calls or contests, or other
                                    blatant disregard of the rules.
                                
                                    Any flagrant foul does not require a pattern
                                    to result in a TMF or PMF.
                                
                                    A single particularly violent “harmful
                                    endangerment” infraction can be
                                    grounds for a PMF or an ejection, at the
                                    discretion of the observer who witnesses the
                                    incident.
                                
                                    A single particularly egregious
                                    demonstration of disregard for the rules,
                                    such as an intentional infraction or clearly
                                    unfounded call, can be grounds for a TMF.

                                    If, after being warned,
                                    team members

                            the discretion of the observer.
                        
Any behavior that would warrant the
                            issuance of a TMF, but which occurs in a game
                            without
                            observers, can result in sanctions upon a complaint filed to
                            the ADA.
                        
Implementation
                    

Any observer may assess a Technical
                            Foul, TMF, PMF, or ejection.
                            

The infraction must have
                                    been witnessed by at least one official.
                                



For PMFs and ejections, play stops
                            as soon as possible.
                            

For the purpose of the
                                    Continuation Rule (17.C), the situation should be treated like an
                                    injury called at the time of the infraction.
                                



For Technical Fouls and TMFs,
                            active play should not be stopped; the foul should
                            be assessed at the next
                            stoppage of play.
                        

Personal Misconduct Fouls and
                            Ejections
                            

An ejected
                                    team member
                                    must immediately leave the general area
                                    where their game is being played, as
                                    directed by the ADA.
                                    

In practice
                                            this means the
                                            team member
                                            must remove themselves at least 100
                                            yards from their team’s
                                            current playing field and refrain
                                            from interacting with any
                                            team members, spectators, or officials involved
                                            in that game.
                                        

Failure to do
                                            so results in a forfeit for that
                                            team member’s
                                            team.
                                        



If a
                                    team member
                                    participates in a game from which they have
                                    been ejected, that
                                    team member
                                    is suspended for the entire tournament, the
                                    team member’s
                                    team forfeits that game, and harsher
                                    sanctions may also result, depending on the
                                    event.
                                

A team whose player is
                                    ejected may substitute another player, and
                                    the opposing team also may exchange a player
                                    if they wish.
                                

All players must remain
                                    in the positions they occupied when play
                                    stopped, unless the ejection also triggers a
                                    Team Misconduct Penalty, as described in the
                                    following sections.
                                



Team Misconduct Penalty Against the
                            Offense
                            

There are two options
                                    available to the defense to continue play
                                    after a Team Misconduct Penalty against the
                                    offense assessed during a
                                    stoppage of play.
                                    

The disc is
                                            moved to the reverse brick mark,
                                            away from the end zone of attack.
                                            The offense is given 30 seconds to
                                            set up anywhere on the playing
                                            field. After all
                                            offensive players
                                            have assumed stationary positions,
                                            the defense has an additional 20
                                            seconds to match up and check the
                                            disc in with a stall count of one.
                                        

The disc and
                                            players stay where they were when
                                            play stopped. Once players are
                                            ready, the count resumes at the
                                            stall count reached plus one, or at
                                            nine if over eight.
                                        





Team Misconduct Penalty Against the
                            Defense
                            

There are three options
                                    available to the offense to continue play
                                    after a Team Misconduct Penalty against the
                                    defense assessed during a
                                    stoppage of play.
                                    

The disc is
                                            moved to the brick mark closest the
                                            end zone of attack. The offense has
                                            30 seconds to set up anywhere on the
                                            playing field. After all
                                            offensive players
                                            have assumed stationary positions,
                                            the defense has an additional 20
                                            seconds to match up and check the
                                            disc in with a stall count of one.
                                        

The disc is
                                            centered on the long axis of the
                                            field. The offense has 30 seconds to
                                            set up anywhere on the playing
                                            field. After all
                                            offensive players
                                            have assumed stationary positions,
                                            the defense has an additional 20
                                            seconds to match up and check the
                                            disc in with a stall count of one.
                                        

The disc and
                                            players stay where they were when
                                            play stopped. Once players are
                                            ready, the defense checks in the
                                            disc with a stall count of one.
                                        





Team Misconduct Penalty Assessed
                            Between Points
                            

If a Team Misconduct
                                    Penalty is assessed after the completion of
                                    a point, there is no pull.
                                

If the penalty is against
                                    the receiving team, the disc is put into
                                    play at the brick mark in the end zone they
                                    are defending (refer to TMF against offense
                                    above).
                                

If the penalty is against
                                    the pulling team, the receiving team puts
                                    the disc into play at the brick mark closest
                                    to the end zone they are attacking (refer to
                                    TMF against defense above,
                                    B3.F).
                                

Each team may substitute
                                    players as per 8.A.1.
                                

Each
                                    offensive player
                                    must establish a stationary position by 90
                                    seconds after the previous goal was scored.
                                

The defense has 105
                                    seconds after the previous goal was scored
                                    or up to 15 seconds after all
                                    offensive players
                                    have established their positions (whichever
                                    is longer) to check the disc into play.
                                



Declined Team Misconduct Penalties
                            

A
                                    captain
                                    can decline a misconduct penalty and leave
                                    the disc as is.
                                

In exceptional
                                    circumstances,
                                    observers
                                    may deny the declination if they feel the
                                    teams are trying to circumvent mandatory
                                    tournament rules, guidelines, or player
                                    safety.
                                




Any observer may assess a Technical
                            Foul, TMF, PMF, or ejection.
                            

The infraction must have
                                    been witnessed by at least one official.
                                


The infraction must have
                                    been witnessed by at least one official.
                                
For PMFs and ejections, play stops
                            as soon as possible.
                            

For the purpose of the
                                    Continuation Rule (17.C), the situation should be treated like an
                                    injury called at the time of the infraction.

For Technical Fouls and TMFs,
                            active play should not be stopped; the foul should
                            be assessed at the next
                            stoppage of play.
                        
Personal Misconduct Fouls and
                            Ejections
                            

An ejected

                                    must immediately leave the general area
                                    where their game is being played, as
                                    directed by the ADA.
                                    

In practice
                                            this means the
                                            team member
                                            must remove themselves at least 100
                                            yards from their team’s
                                            current playing field and refrain
                                            from interacting with any
                                            team members, spectators, or officials involved
                                            in that game.
                                        

Failure to do
                                            so results in a forfeit for that
                                            team member’s
                                            team.
                                        



If a
                                    team member
                                    participates in a game from which they have

                                    sanctions may also result, depending on the
                                    event.
                                

A team whose player is
                                    ejected may substitute another player, and
                                    the opposing team also may exchange a player
                                    if they wish.
                                

All players must remain
                                    in the positions they occupied when play
                                    stopped, unless the ejection also triggers a
                                    Team Misconduct Penalty, as described in the
                                    following sections.

                                            field. The offense has 30 seconds to
                                            set up anywhere on the playing
                                            field. After all
                                            offensive players
                                            have assumed stationary positions,
                                            the defense has an additional 20
                                            seconds to match up and check the
                                            disc in with a stall count of one.
                                        
The disc and
                                            players stay where they were when
                                            play stopped. Once players are
                                            ready, the defense checks in the
                                            disc with a stall count of one.

                            this edition of the rules. Requirements are likely
                            to come in future editions based on continued
                            research and experience with adapting the sport for
                            youth age groups.

                                    the tape twist along its length, the
                                    “top” is always the side that is
                                    facing up, even if that changes along the
                                    length.

                            excluding the top of the tape are part of the
                            playing field and in-bounds.
                        

The top of the goal line is part of
                            the central zone.

Perimeter and end zone lines are
                            established with field lining tape (preferred) or
                            rope.
                            

                                    The top of the tape is the portion of the
                                    field tape that is facing upwards. Should
                                    the tape twist along its length, the
                                    “top” is always the side that is
                                    facing up, even if that changes along the
                                    length.

The top of the perimeter lines is
                            not part of the playing field and is out-of-bounds.
                        
The area directly under the
                            perimeter lines and all parts of the perimeter lines
                            excluding the top of the tape are part of the
                            playing field and in-bounds.
                        
The top of the goal line is part of
                            the central zone.

Sand Stoppages
                    

Any player may briefly extend a
                            stoppage of play
                            to remove interfering sand from their face, but
                            active play may not be stopped for this purpose.

Sand Fouls
                    

A sand foul occurs when a player
                            causes sand to fly into an opponent’s face in
                            a way that significantly interferes with their play,
                            such as in the eyes or up their nose.
                        

A sand foul is considered distinct
                            and separate to the action that caused it and should
                            be resolved separately as such.
