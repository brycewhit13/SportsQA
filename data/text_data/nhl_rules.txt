9Rule 8 –Injured Players
8.1 Injured Player -When a player is injured or compelled to leave the 
ice during a game, he may retire from the game and be replaced by a 
substitute, but play must continue without the teams leaving the ice.
During the play, if an injured player wishes to retire from the ice 
and be replaced by a substitute, he must do so at the players’ bench
and not through any other exit leading from the rink. This is not a legal
player change and therefore when a violation occurs, a bench minor 
penalty shall be imposed.

dressing room without taking a seat on the penalty bench. If the
injured player receives a minor penalty, the penalized team shall 
immediately put a substitute player on the penalty bench, who shall
serve the penalty until such time as the injured player is able to return 
to the game. He would replace his teammate on the penalty bench at 
the next stoppage of play. If the injured player receives a major

the penalized player shall be permitted to enter the game except from
the penalty bench. For violation of this rule, a bench minor penalty 
shall be imposed.

penalty bench return to his players’ bench prior to the expiration of his
penalty, he shall not be eligible to play until his penalty has expired. 
This includes coincidental penalties when his sub stitute is still in the
penalty box awaiting a stoppage in play.  The injured player must wait 
until his substitute has been released from the penalty box before he
is eligible to play.  If, however, there is a stoppage of play prior to the
expiration of h is penalty, he must then replace his teammate on the 
penalty bench and is then eligible to return once his penalty has
expired.
When a player is injured so that he cannot continue play or go to 
his bench, the play shall not be stopped until the inj ured player’s team 
has secured control of the puck. If the player’s team is in control of the
puck at the time of injury, play shall be stopped immediately unless his
team is in a scoring position.
In the case where it is obvious that a player has sustaine d a
serious injury, the Referee and/or Linesman may stop the play
immediately.
When play has been stopped by the Referee or Linesman due to 
an injured player, or whenever an injured player is attended to on the
ice by the Trainer or medical personnel, such player must be 
substituted for immediately. This injured player cannot return to the ice 
until play has resumed.
When play is stopped for an injured player, the ensuing face -off 
shall be conducted at the face -off spot in the zone nearest the location 
of the puck when the play was stopped.  When the injured player’s 
team has control of the puck in the attacking zone, the face -off shall

name the starting line -up to the Referee or Official Scorer.
Prior to the start of the game, the Manager or Coach of the home 
team, having been advised by the Official Scorer the names of the
starting line -up of the visiting team, shall name the starting line -up of 
the home team. This information sh all be conveyed by the Official 
Scorer to the Coach of the visiting team.
No change in the starting line -up of either team as given to the
Official Scorer, or in the playing line -up on the ice, can be made
unless reviewed and approved by the Referee prior to the start of the
game.  
7.2 Violation -For an infraction of this rule, a bench minor penalty shall 
be imposed upon the offending team . This is an appeal play and must 
be brought to the Referee’s attention prior to the second face -off in the
game. There is no penalty to the requesting team if their appeal is
unsustained. The determining factor is the player or goalkeeper’s 
name, and not necessarily the player or goalkeeper’s number, must 
be correctly listed by the team. 
In the event a team scores on the first shift of the game, and it is
brought to the attention of the Referee by the opposing team that the
team that scored did not have the correct starting line -up on the ice, 
the goal shall be allowed and a bench minor pe nalty assessed to the
offending team for having an improper starting line -up. If the team that 
scores a goal on the first shift of the game challenges the starting line -
up of the opposing team and the opposing team did not have the 
correct starting lin e-up, the scoring of the goal would nullify the bench 
minor penalty and no further penalties would be assessed. SECTION 2 - TEAMS

8.1 Injured Player  - When a player is injured or compelled to leave the

During the play, if an injured player wishes to retire from the ice 
and be replaced by a substitute, he must do so at the players’ bench 
and not through any other exit leading from the rink. This is not a legal player change and therefore when a violation occurs, a bench minor

the penalized player shall be permitted to enter the game except from 
the penalty bench. For violation of this rule, a bench minor penalty 
shall be imposed. 
Should the injured penalized player who has been replaced on the 
penalty bench return to his players’ bench prior to the expiration of his 
penalty, he shall not be eligible to play until his penalty has expired. This includes coincidental penalties when his substitute is still in the 
penalty box awaiting a stoppage in play.  The injured player must wait 
until his substitute has been released from the penalty box before he is eligible to play.  If, however, there is a stoppage of play prior to the 
expiration of h is penalty, he must then replace his teammate on the 
penalty bench and is then eligible to return once his penalty has 
expired. 
When a player is injured so that he cannot continue play or go to 
his bench, the play shall not be stopped until the injured player’s team 
has secured control of the puck. If the player’s team is in control of the 
puck at the time of injury, play shall be stopped immediately unless his 
team is in a scoring position. 
In the case where it is obvious that a player has sustained a 
serious injury, the Referee and/or Linesman may stop the play 
immediately. 
When play has been stopped by the Referee or Linesman due to 
an injured player, or whenever an injured player is attended to on the 
ice by the Trainer or medical personnel, such player must be substituted for immediately. This injured player cannot return to the ice 
until play has resumed. 
When play is stopped for an injured player, the ensuing face-off 
shall be conducted at the face-off spot in the zone nearest the location 
of the puck when the play was stopped.  When the injured player’s 
team has control of the puck in the attacking zone, the face- off shall 
be conducted at the nearest face- off spot  in the neutral zone.  When SECTION 2 - TEAMS

The Referee shall report to the Commissioner for disciplinary 
action any delay in making a goalkeeper substitution. 
The substitute goalkeeper shall be subject to the regular rules 
governing goalkeepers and shall be entitled to the same privileges.

stoppage of play.  For a violation of the rule, a minor penalty for delay 
of game shall be assessed. 
When play has been stopped by the Referee or Linesman due to

Each goalkeeper must wear pads that are anatomically proportional
and size specific based on the individual physical characteri stics of 
that goalkeeper. The Hockey Operations Department will have the 
complete discretion to determine the maximum height of each
goalkeeper's pads based on measurements obtained by the Hockey 
Operations Department, which will include the floor to center of knee 
and center of knee to pelvis measurements. Each goalkeeper will be 
given a Limiting Distance Size based on these measurements. The 
Limiting Distance Size will be the sum of the floor to knee and 4 5% of 
the knee to pelvis measure ments plus a four inch (4”) allowance for 
the height of the skate. The Limiting Distance Size is a vertical
measurement from the playing surface and will be measured with the
Limiting Distance Gauge when inspected at the clearing house phase 
and during any spot checks to ensure compliance .  Any pads deemed 
too large for a goalkeeper will be considered illegal equipment for that 
goalkeeper, regardless of whether or not they would have fallen within 
previous equipment maximums. The minimum lengt h of the boot of 
the pad is to be no less than seven inches (7''). The goal pad must 
have a defined boot channel with no inserts. The channel must be big
enough so that the skate slots into it and is not resting on the pad.  No 
attachments such as plastic puck foils are permitted.  Pads can only 
be ten and one -half inches (101/2'') deep.  The measurement will be 
taken from the front face of the pad to the last edge of the inner knee 
protection.
Calf-wing protectors cannot be attached to the five-hole or the five -
hole seam.  Calf -wings must be inset one -half inch (1/2'') from the
inside five -hole, creating a distinct edge, and attached to the back 
cover.  Calf -wing protectors must be one piece and cannot include

1810.6 Stick Measurement –Prior to Penalty Shot –A stick measurement 
request may be made prior to a penalty shot following the seguidelines :
First Stick
If the stick is “legal” the complaining Club is assessed a bench 
minor penalty, and a player is placed in the penalty box immediately.  
Regardless as to the result of the shot, the bench minor penalty is 
assessed and served.
If the stick is “illega l” the player will be assessed a minor penalty. 
He will be ordered to obtain a new (second) stick prior to the shot.
After he takes the shot he will be required to serve his penalty.
Second stick
The player will be told that the second stick will b e measured prior to 
theshot to verify the legality of the stick.
If the second stick is “legal”, proceed with the shot.
If second stick is “illegal”, disallow the opportunity for the shot and
assess one minor penalty for the first illegal stick.
If the player refuses to surrender his stick for measurement , the
shot shall not be per mitted and the player shall be assessed a 
misconduct penalty. 
10.7 Stick Measurement –Prior to Shootout Attempt –A stick 
measurement request must be made prior to the Referee blowing his 
whistle to begin the shootout attempt.
If the stick is “legal” the complaining Club forfeits their next 
shootout attempt. In addition, the complaining Club’s Coach shall be 
fined one thousand dollars ($1000) and the Club shall be fined five 
thousand dollars ($5000). Their next shootout attempt would be
recorded as “no goal”.
If the stick is “illegal”, the offending team forfeits that shootout
attempt by that player, and the player becomes ineligible to participate 
in the shootout. In addition, the player is fined one thousand dollars 
($1000) and his Club is fined fi ve thousand dollars ($5000).  This 
shootout attempt would be recorded as “no goal”.

Rule 11 –Goalkeeper’s Equipment
11.1 Goalkeeper’s Equipment -With the exception of skates and stick, all 
the equipment worn by the goalkeeper must be constructed solely for 
the purpose of protection , and he must not wear any garment or use
any contrivance which wou ld give him undue assistance in keeping 
goal.
TheHockey Operations Department is specifically authorized to 
make a check of each teams’ equipment (including goalkeepers’’ 
sticks) to ensure the compliance with the rule. It shall report its 
findings to the Commissioner for his disciplinary action. SECTION 3 - EQUIPMENT

19 11.2 Leg Gu ards – The leg guards worn by goalkeepers shall not exceed 
eleven inches (11'') in extr eme width when on the le g of the player .  
Each goalkeepe r must wear pads that are anatomically proportional 
and size specific based on the individual physical characteristics of 
that goalkeepe r. The Hockey Operations Department will have the 
complete discretion to determine the maximum height of each 
goalkeepe r's pads based on measurements obtained by the Hockey 
Operations Department, which will include the floor to center of knee and center of knee to pelvis measurements. Each goalkeeper will be given a Limiting Distance Size based on these measurements. The Limiting Distance Size will be the sum of the floor to knee and 45% of 
the knee t o pelvis measure ments plus a four inch (4”) allowance for 
the he ight of the skate. The Limiting Distance Size is a vertical 
measurement from the playing surface and will be measured with the 
Limiting Dista nce Gauge when inspected at the clearing house phase 
and dur ing any spot checks to ensure compliance.  Any pads deemed 
too large for a goalkeeper will be considered illegal equipment for that 
goalkeeper, regardless of whether or not they would have fallen within previous equipment maximums.  The minimum length of the boot of 
the pad is to be no less than seven inches (7''). The goal pad must 
have a defined boot channel with no inserts. The channel must be big 
enough so that the skate slots into it and is not resting on the pad.  No 
attachments such as plastic puck foils are permitted.  Pads can only be ten and one-half in ches (10
1/2'') deep.  The measurement will be 
taken from the front face of the pad to the last edge of the inner knee 
protection. 
Calf-wing protectors cannot be attached t o the five-hole or the five-
hole seam.  Calf-wings must be inset one-half inch (1/2'') from the 
inside five-hole, creating a distinct edge , and attached to the back 
cover.  Calf -wing protectors must be one piece and canno t include 
wedges (removable or non-removable).  Calf-wing protectors may be 
flat for five and one-half inches (51/2'') before contouring to the shape 
of the leg.  Calf-wing protectors must contour and cannot be visible to 
the shooter when strapped to the goalkeeper’s leg.  Calf-wing 
protectors may not exceed one inch (1”) in thickness.  Calf-wing 
protector straps must run through or wrap around so the calf protector 
follows the contour of the goalkeeper’s leg even if the straps are worn 
loosely.  No zippers, Velcro, or Velcro attachments are a llowed.  
The knee strap p ad is not to exceed six inches (6'') in le ngth by 
five and one-half inches (51/2'') in width. The knee str ap pa d must be 
fastened to the inner ris ers/lifts  The inner knee risers are not to 
exceed seven inches (7”) in length by five and one-half inches (51/2'') 
in width.  The length of seven inches (7”) is measured from where the 
inner padding attaches to the leg pad and back to the e nd of the inner 
padding. The total measuremen t of the entire inner knee padding (pad 
risers) including the outer knee strap pad must not exceed two and 
one-half inches (21/2'') in thickness and will be measured when non-
compressed. Knee strap pads and riser/lifts must have a one inch (1”)

outside top ridge of the
edge/binding. 
3) If at the junction of the cuff and catch 
portions of the glove there is a “jagged 
point,” the measurement tape will 
follow the imaginary perpendicular line 
to the glove ridge above. (A “jagged
joint” anywhere else on the glove will
not be allowed this “straight line” 
privilege, i.e. where the trap joins the main glove).

Any violation of this rule will result in an automatic two (2) game 
suspension to the offending goalkeeper. Should both goalkeepers on 
a Club have illegal equipment, bo th will be s uspended in sequence. 
The goalkeeper who played the day/night of the measurement will be 
suspended for the next two (2) games played by his team, and the back-
up goalkeeper will be suspended for the subsequent two (2)  games. 
A goalkeeper who plays with equipment that has not been 
inspected and approved by the Hockey Operations Department, or 
who tampers with equipment after it has been inspected and approved

Should a minor or bench minor penalty be signaled against a team SECTION 4 – TYPES OF PENALTIES  
NATIONAL HOCKEY LEAGUE  OFFICIAL RULES 2021-2022 
28 already short-handed by reason of a major (or match) penalty, but 
before the play can be stopped to assess the minor or bench minor 
penalty, and a goal is scored by the non-offending side, the signaled 
minor or bench minor penalty shall not be imposed due to the scoring of the goal. 
Should a penalty be signaled against a team already short-handed 
by reason of one or more minor or bench minor penalties, and the signaled penalty would result in the awarding of a penalty shot, but 
before the Referee can stop play to award the penalty shot, the non-offending team scores a goal, then the signaled penalty (that would 
have resulted in a penalty shot) shall be assessed as a minor (double-
minor, major or match) penalty and the first of the minor penalties 
already being served shall automatically terminate under Rule 16 – 
Minor Penalties.  
15.5 Face-off Locations  – When players are penalized at a stoppage of 
play so as to result in one or more penalties being placed on the 
penalty time clock to one team, the ensuing face- off shall be 
conducted at one of the two face-off spots in the offending team’s end zone.  The re are only three (3) exceptions to this application: 
(i) when a penalty is assessed after the scoring of a goal –  face- off at center
ice;. 
(ii) when a penalty is assessed at the end (or start) of a period – face-off at 
center ice;

numerical strength o f its opponent on the ice at the time the goal is 
scored. The minor or bench minor penalty which terminates 
automatically is the one with the least amount of time on the clock. 
Thus coincident minor penalties to both Teams do not cause either side to be “short-handed” (see  Rule 19 – Coincidental Penalties ). 
If while a team is “short-handed” by one or more minor or bench 
minor penalties, the opposing team scores a goal, the first of such penalties shall automatically terminate. 
This rule shall also apply when a goal is awarded. 
This rule does not apply when a goal is scored on a penalty shot 
(i.e. offending team’s penalized player(s) do not get released on the

automatically is the one with the least amount of time on the clock. 
Thus coincident minor penalties to both Teams do not cause either 
side to be “s hort-handed” (see Rule 19–Coincidental Penalties ).
If while a team is “short -handed” by one or more minor or bench
minor penalties, the opposing team scores a goal, the first of such
penalties shall automatically terminate.

30 Rule 19 – Coincidental Penalties 
19.1 Coincidental Minor Penalties  - When coincident al minor penalties or 
coincident al minor penalties of equal duration are imposed against 
players of both teams, the penalized players shall all take their places 
on the penalty benches and such penalized players shall not leave the 
penalty bench until the first stoppage of play following the expiry of their respective penalties. Where goalkeepers are involved, refer to 
27.1.  Immediate substitution shall be made for an equal number of 
minor penalties or coincident al minor penalties of equal duration to 
each team so penalized and the penalties of the players for which substitutions have been made shall not be taken into account for the 
purpose of the delayed penalty rule (Rule 26 – Delayed Penalties ). 
This rule only applies when at least one team is already serving a time 
penalty in the penalty box that causes them to be short- handed.  
When one minor penalty is assessed to one player of each team at 
the same stoppage in play, these penalties will be served without 
substitution provided there are no other penalties in effect and visible 
on the p enalty clocks. Both teams will therefore play four skaters 
against four skaters for the duration of the minor penalties. 
Should one or both of these players (or any other players) also 
incur a misconduct penalty in addition to their one minor penalty, this rule shall apply and the teams would still play four skaters against four 
skaters (the player incurring the misconduct penalty would have to 
serve the entire 12 minutes – minor plus misconduct – and his team 
would have to place an additional player on the penalty bench to serve 
the minor penalty and be able to return to the ice when the minor 
penalty expires).  
When multiple penalties are assessed to both teams, equal 
numbers of minor and major penalties shall be eliminated using the 
coincident al penalty rule and any differential in time penalties shall be 
served in the normal manner and displayed on the penalty time clock accordingly (see 19.5). If there is no differential in time penalties, all 
players will serve their allotted penalty time, but will not be released 
until the first stoppage of play following the expiration of their respective penalties. 
For coincidental penalties that carry over into, or are assessed 
during regular- season overtime, refer to 84.3, to Reference Tables – 
Table 17 – Penalties In Effect Prior to the Start of Overt ime – Regular 
Season on page 160 , and to Reference Tables – Table 18  – Penalties 
Assessed in Overt ime – Regular Season on page 161. 
19.2 Coincidental Major Penalties  - When coincident al major penalties or 
coincident al penalties of equal duration, including a major and/or a 
match  penalty, are imposed against players of both teams, the 
penalized players shall all take their places on the penalty benches 
and such penalized players shall not leave the penalty benches until 
the first stoppage of play following the expiry of their respective 
penalties. Immediate substitutions shall be made for an equal number of major penalties, or coincident al penalties of equal duration including 
a major penalty to each team so penalized, and the penalties of the SECTION 4 –TYPES OF PENALTIES
NATIONAL HOCKEY LEAGUE OFFICIAL RULES 20 21-2022
31players for which substitutions have been made shall not be taken into 
account for the purpose of the delayed penalty rule, (Rule 26–
Delayed Penalties ). In such situations, if one or bot h players have 
received a game misconduct in addition to their major penalties, no 
substitutes are required to take their places on the penalty benches. 
19.3 Coincidental Match Penalties -When coincident almatch penalties 
or coincident alpenalties of equ al duration, including a major and/or a
match penalty, are imposed against players of both teams, the players 
with the match penalties shall be immediately removed from the
game. The remaining penalized players shall not leave the penalty 
benches until the first stoppage of play following the expiry of their
respective penalties. Immediate substitutions shall be made for an
equal number of major and/or match penalties, or coincident al
penalties of equal duration including a major or match penalty to each 
team so penalized, and the penalties of the players for which 
substitutions have been made shall not be taken into account for the
purpose of the delayed penalty rule, (Rule 26–Delayed Penalties ). 
19.4 Last Five Minutes and Overtime -During the last five (5) minutes of 
regulation time, or at any time in overtime, when a minor penalty (or
double -minor penalty) is assessed to one player of Team A, and a 
major (or match) penalty is assessed to one player of Team B at the
same stoppage of play, the three -minute (or one -minute) differential 
shall be served immediately as a major penalty. This is also applicable 
when coincidental penalties are negated, leaving the aforementioned 
examples. In such instances, the team of the player receiving the
major penalty must place the replacement player in the penalty bench
prior to expiration of the penalty. In the case of a match penalty, the 
team must place the replacement player in the penalty bench 
immediately. The differential will be recorded on the penalty clock as a 
three (3) minute or a one (1) minute penalty (as applicable), and
served in the same manner as a major penalty. This rule shall be 
applied regardless as to the on -ice strength of the two teams at the
time the above outlined penaltie s are assessed.
19.5 Applying the Coincidental Penalty Rule –When multiple penalties 
are assessed to both teams at the same stoppage of play, the
following rules are to be utilized by the Referees to determine the on -
ice strength for both teams:
(i) Cancel as many major and/or match penalties as possible
(ii) Cancel as many minor, bench minor and or double -minor penalties as 
possible

19.1 Coincidental Minor Penalties -When coincident alminor penalties or 
coincident alminor penalties of equal duration are imposed against 
players of both teams, the penalized players shall all take their places 
on the penalty benches and such penalized players shall not leave the 
penalty bench until the first stoppage of play following t he expiry of 
their respective penalties. Where goalkeepers are involved, refer to 
27.1.  Immediate substitution shall be made for an equal number of 
minor penalties or coincident alminor penalties of equal duration to 
each team so penalized and the penalti es of the players for which 
substitutions have been made shall not be taken into account for the
purpose of the delayed penalty rule (Rule 26–Delayed Penalties ). 
This rule only applies when at least one team is already serving a time 
penalty in the penal ty box that causes them to be short -handed.
When one minor penalty is assessed to one player of each team at 
the same stoppage in play, these penalties will be served without 
substitution provided there are no other penalties in effect and visible 
on the p enalty clocks. Both teams will therefore play four skaters 
against four skaters for the duration of the minor penalties.
Should one or both of these players (or any other players) also 
incur a misconduct penalty in addition to their one minor penalty, this
rule shall apply and the teams would still play four skaters against four 
skaters (the player incurring the misconduct penalty would have to 
serve the entire 12 minutes –minor plus misconduct –and his team 
would have to place an additional player on the penalty bench to serve
the minor penalty and be able to return to the ice when the minor 
penalty expires).
When multiple penalties are assessed to both teams, equal 
numbers of minor and major penalties shall be eliminated using the 
coincident alpenalty rule and any differential in time penalties shall be 
served in the normal manner and displayed on the penalty time clock 
accordingly (see 19.5). If there is no differential in time penalties, all
players will serve their allotted penalty time, but will not be released 
until the first stoppage of play following the expiration of their 
respective penalties.
For coincidental penalties that carry over into, or are assessed 
during regular -season overtime, refer to 84.3, to Reference Tables –
Table 1 7–Penalties In Effect Prior to the Start of Overt ime–Regular
Season on page 1 60, and to Reference Tables –Table 18 –Penalties

19.2 Coincidental Major Penalties -When coincident almajor penalties or 
coincident alpenalties of equal duration, including a major and/or a 
match penalty, are imposed against players of both teams, the
penalized players shall all take their places on the penalty benches
and such penalized players shall not leave the penalty benches until 
the first stoppage of play following the expiry of their respective 
penalties. Immediate substitutions shall be made for an equal number 
of major penalties, or coincident alpenalties of equal duration including 
a major penalty to each team so penalized, and the penalties of theSECTION 4 – TYPES OF PENALTIES

account for the purpose of the delayed penalty rule, (Rule 26 – 
Delayed Penalties). In such situations, if one or both players have 
received a game misconduct in addition to their major penalties, no 
substitutes are required to take their places on the penalty benches.  
19.3 Coincidental Match Penalties  - When coincident al match penalties 
or coincident al penalties of equ al duration, including a major and/or a 
match penalty, are imposed against players of both teams, the players 
with the match penalties shall be immediately removed from the game. The remaining penalized players shall not leave the penalty 
benches until the first stoppage of play following the expiry of their 
respective penalties. Immediate substitutions shall be made for an 
equal number of major and/or match penalties, or coincident al 
penalties of equal duration including a major or match penalty to each team so penalized, and the penalties of the players for which 
substitutions have been made shall not be taken into account for the 
purpose of the delayed penalty rule, (Rule  26 – Delayed Penalties ).  
19.4 Last Five Minutes and Overtime  - During the last five (5) minutes of 
regulation time, or at any time in overtime, when a minor penalty (or 
double-minor penalty) is assessed to one player of Team A, and a 
major (or match) penalty is assessed to one player of Team B at the same stoppage of play, the three- minute (or one -minute) differential 
shall be served immediately as a major penalty. This is also applicable when coincidental penalties are negated, leaving the aforementioned examples. In such instances, the team of the player receiving the 
major penalty must place the replacement player in the penalty bench prior to expiration of the penalty. In the case of a match penalty, the team must place the replacement player in the penalty bench 
immediately. The differential will be recorded on the penalty clock as a 
three (3) minute or a one (1) minute penalty (as applicable), and 
served in the same manner as a major penalty.  This rule shall be 
applied regardless as to the on-ice strength of the two teams at the time the above outlined penaltie s are assessed.  
19.5 Applying the Coincidental Penalty Rule – When multiple penalties 
are assessed to both teams at the same stoppage of play, the 
following rules are to be utilized by the Referees to determine the on-
ice strength for both teams: 
(i) Cancel as many major and/or match penalties as possible
(ii) Cancel as many minor, bench minor and or double -minor penalties as 
possible

page 151.  SECTION 4 – TYPES OF PENALTIES  
NATIONAL HOCKEY LEAGUE  OFFICIAL RULES 2021-2022 
32 Rule 20 – Major Penalties 
20.1 Major Penalty  - For the first major penalty in any one game, the 
offender, except the goalkeeper, shall be ruled off the ice for five (5) 
minutes during which time no substitute shall be permitted. 
When one player receives a major penalty and a minor penalty at 
the same time, the major penalty shall be served first by the penalized 
player (or substitute for the goalkeeper), except under Rule  19.2 
where coincidental major penalties are in effect, in which case the 
minor penalty will be recorded and served first.  
20.2 Short-handed – Although a major penalty does cause a team to be 
short-handed, the penalized player serving the major penalty does not 
leave the penalty bench when the opposing team scores. The player must wait for the entire major penalty to expire before he is permitted 
to exit the penalty bench.  
20.3 Substitution – When a player has been assessed a major penalty 
and has been removed from the game or is injured, the offending 
team does not have to place a substitute player on the penalty bench 
immediately, but must do so at a stoppage of play prior to the 
expiration of the major penalty. He may then legally exit the penalty 
bench when the major penalty has expired.  If the player has been 
assessed minor penalties in addition to the major penalty that must 
also be served on the penalty time clock, the offending team must 
place a substitute on the penalty bench immediately. 
Failure to place a player on the penalty bench prior to the 
expiration of the major penalty will result in that team having to 
continue playing one player short (but not officially considered short-handed) until the next stoppage of play. Any replacement player who 
enters the game other than from the penalty bench shall constitute an

has fully expired may return to the ice.  
During the play,  the Penalty Timekeeper shall permit the 
penalized players to return to the ice, in the order of expiration of their 
penalties, but only when the penalized team is entitled to have more 
than four players on the ice. Otherwise, these players must wait until 
the first stoppage of play after the expiration of their penalties in order to be released from the penalty bench. 
When the penalties of two players of the same team will expire 
at the same time, the Captain of that team will designate to the 
Referee which player will return to the ice first and the Referee will 
instruct the Penalty Timekeeper accordingly (this is done to expedite 
the release of a player from the penalty bench when the opposing team scores on the power-play).  
26.3 Major and Minor Penalty  - When a major and a minor penalty are 
imposed at the same time on different players of the same team, the Penalty Timekeeper shall record the minor as being the first penalty. 
Rule 27  – Goalkeeper’s Penalties 
27.1 Minor Penalty to Goalkeeper  – A goalkeeper shall not be sent to the 
penalty bench for an offense which incurs a minor penalty, but 
instead, the minor penalty shall be served by another member of his team who was on the ice when the offense was committed. This 
player is to be designated by the Coach of the offending team through the playing Captain and such substitute shall not be changed.  
A penalized player may not serve a goalkeeper’s penalty. 
If the goalkeeper is involved in coincidental penalties being 
assessed and as a result, his team is required to play shorthanded 
due to additional penalties assessed to the goalkeeper, the player 
designated to serve the additional time penalties assessed to the 
goalkeeper may be any player as designated by the Coach of the 
offending team through the Captain. 
27.2 Major Penalty to Goalkeeper  – A goalkeeper shall not be sent to the 
penalty bench for an offense which incurs a major penalty, but 
instead, the major penalty shall be served immediately by another 
member of his team who was on the ice when the offense was 
committed. This player is to be designated by the Coach of the 
offending team through the Captain and such substitute shall not be 
changed. 
When a goalkeeper is assessed a major penalty plus a game 
misconduct, which is coincidental with a major or match penalty to the 
opposing team, no player is required to serve the goalkeeper’s 
penalties in the penalty box, since he has been ejected from the 
game. 
Should a goalkeeper incur three major penalties in one game, he 
shall be ruled off the ice for the balance of the game and his place 
shall be taken by a member of his own Club, or by a regular substitute SECTION 4 – TYPES OF PENALTIES

goalkeeper’s full equipment. (Major penalty plus game misconduct 
penalty.)  
27.3 Misconduct Penalty to Goalkeeper  – Should a goalkeeper on the 
ice incur a misconduct penalty, this penalty shall be served by another 
member of his team who was on the ice when the offense was 
committed. This player is to be designated by the Manager or Coach 
of the offending team through the Captain. 
27.4 Game Misconduct Penalty to Goalkeeper  – Should a goalkeeper 
incur a game misconduct penalty, his place will then be taken by a 
member of his own Club, or by a regular substitute goalkeeper who is 
available, and such player will be allowed the goalkeeper’s full 
equipment.  
27.5 Match Penalty to Goalkeeper  – Should a goalkeeper incur a match 
penalty, his pl ace will then be taken by a member of his own Club, or 
by a substitute goalkeeper who is available, and such player will be 
allowed the goalkeeper’s full equipment.  
The match penalty, and any additional penalties assessed to the 
goalkeeper, shall be served immediately by a member of the team on 
the ice when the offenses were committed. This player shall be 
designated by the Coach of the offending team through the Captain. However, when the match penalty is coincidental with a match or 
major penalty to the opposing team, no player is required to proceed 
to the penalty bench to serve the goalkeeper’s match penalty.  
27.6 Leaving Goal Crease  – A minor penalty shall be imposed on a 
goalkeeper who leaves the immediate vicinity of his crease during an 
altercation. In addition, he shall be reported to the Commissioner for 
further disciplinary action as may be required. However, should the 
altercation occur in or near the goalkeeper’s crease, the Referee 
should direct the goalkeeper to a neutral location and not assess a penalty for leaving the immediate vicinity of the goal crease. Equally, if 
the goalkeeper is legitimately outside the immediate vicinity of the 
goal crease for the purpose of proceeding to the players’ bench to be 
substituted for an extra attacker, and he subsequently becomes 
involved in an altercation, the minor penalty for leaving the crease would not be assessed.  
In addition, during stoppages of play in the game, he must not 
proceed to his players’ bench for the purpose of receiving a 
replacement stick or equipment or repairs thereto, or due to an injury, or to receive instructions, without first obtaining permission to do so 
from the Referee. Otherwise, he must be replaced by the substitute 
goalkeeper immediately (without any delay) or be assessed a bench 
minor penalty for delay of game.   
27.7 Participating in the Play Over the Center Red Line  - If a goalkeeper 
participates in the play in any manner (intentionally plays the puck or 
checks an opponent)  when he is beyond the center red line, a minor 
penalty shall be imposed upon him. The position of the puck is th e 
determining factor for the application of this rule.  SECTION 4 –TYPES OF PENALTIES

the penalty shall be served by another member of his team who was 
on the ice when the offense was committed. Communication with the 
Official Scorer and/or Real Time Scorers is important at this time as 
they can inform the Penalty Timekeeper who was actually on the ice 
to ensure only the proper players can serve the time.

the attention of the Referees any discrepancy between the time 
recorded on the clock and the official correct time and he shall be 
responsible for making any adjustments ordered by the Referees. 
In the event that two players from one team and one player from 
the opposing team are penalized at the same time, the Penalty 
Timekeeper shall request through the Referee or the offending team's 
Captain, which penalty they prefer to have on the timing device. 
35.6 Reports  – Prior to each game, the Penalty Timekeeper shall obtain 
copies of the Instigator, Aggressor & Game Misconduct List provided 
by the League, retain one copy and provide one to the Referees.

time the penalty is assessed to ensure a Game Misconduct penalty is 
applied.  
Upon the completion of each game, the Penalty Timekeeper shall 
complete and sign the Penalty Record form and forward same to the 
League office.  
When penalties are assessed in the final minute of a period where 
tenths of seconds are shown on the clock, the time of the penalty shall be rounded up to the nearest second for the official records. 
The Officiating Department shall be entitled to inspect, collect and 
forward to the League office the actual worksheets used by the Penalty Timekeeper in any game.

must complete a report of the incident (Off-Ice Officials Report of 
Game Misconduct/Match Penalties). When there are more than one of these incidents, it is imperative to provide the Referee with accurate 
information for each incident so that his report(s) to the League office is correct.  SECTION 5 – OFFICIALS

awarded. If the apparent goal by Team A is deemed to have entered 
the goal illegally (e.g., a “distinct kicking motion”), the goal will be
disallowed by the NHL Situation Room; no goal will be awarded to 
Team B either in this circumstance since the play should have been
stopped at the time of the apparent goal. The clock (including penalty 
time clocks, if applicable) shall be re -set to the time of Team A’s 
apparent goal -whether awarded or disallowed.
Any penalties signaled during the period of time between the
apparent goal and the next stoppage of play shall be assessed in the

37.3 Goal Situations S ubjec t to Video Review – The following situations 
are subject to review by the NHL Situation Room: 
(a) Puck crossing the goal line;
(b)  Puck in the net prior to the goal frame being dislodged;
(c) Puck in the net prior to (or after) the expiration of time at the e nd of a 
period; 
(d)  With the use of a foot/skate, was a “distinct kicking motion” evident?
(e)  Puck deliberately directed, batted, or thrown into the net by an 
attacking Player by any means (and with any part of his body) other 
than with his stick;  
(f)Puck deflected directly into the net of an On -Ice Official;
(g) Puck struck or deflected into the net with a high -stick, above the height 
of the  crossbar; 
(h)  Puck entering the net in a proper manner through goal mouth (ensuring 
puck did not enter net improperly through net meshing or underneath the net frame, etc.); 
(i) Puck entering the net as the culmination of a continuous play where the 
result of the play was unaffected by any whistle blown by the Referee 
upon his losing sight of the puck ; and  
(j) The legitimacy of all potential goals on Penalty Shot or Shootout 
attempts to  ensure compliance with applicable rules (e.g., double tap, 
goalkeeper throwing stick, go alkeeper dislodging goal, shooter cradling 
puck above the normal height of the shoulders, shooter performing 
illegal spin -o-rama move, skater’s continued forward advancement of 
puck, goalkeeper leaving crease prior to puck touch at center ice , etc.) 
37.4 Distinct Kicking Motio n – Plays that involve a puck entering the net 
as a direct result of a “distinct kicking motion” shall be ruled NO 
GOAL. A “distinct kicking motion,” for purposes of Video Review, is 
one where the video makes clear that an attacking Player has 
deliberately propelled the puck with a kick of his foot or skate and 
the puck subsequently enters the net. A goal cannot be scored on a 
play where an attacking Player propels the puck with his skate into the 
net (even by means of a subsequent deflection off of another Player) 
using a “distinct kicking motion.” A goal also cannot be scored on a 
play where an attacking Player kicks any equipment (stick, glove, helmet, etc.) at the puck, including kicking the blade of his own stick, 
causing the puck to cross the goal line. A puck that deflects into the SECTION 5 –OFFICIALS
NATIONAL HOCKEY LEAGUE OFFICIAL RULES 20 21-2022
63net off an attacking Player’s skate who does not use a “distinct kicking 
motion” shall be ruled a GOAL. A puck that is directed into the net by 
an attacking Players’ skate shall also be ruled a GOAL, as long
as no “distinct kicking motion” is evident. (See also Rule 49.2)
37.5Puck Struck with a High Stick –The determining factor for High 
Stick Video Review is where the puck makes contact with the stick in 
relation to the crossbar. If the puck makes contact with a portion of the
stick that is at or below the level of the crossbar (despite some other
portion of the stick being above the crossbar) and enters the goal, the
goal shall be allowed.
37.6Video Review to Verify Time on Clock –The NHL Situation Room
may use Video Review to establish the correct time on the clock. The 
“burn in” of the game clock is mandatory for the two overhead goal 
video feeds, and should be made available by the host broadcaster on 
as many additional feeds as possible.
Any loss of time on the game or penalty clocks due to a false face -
off, a face -offviolation or a puck going out of play must be replaced. 
The NHL Situation Room ma ybe consulted or may intervene with On -
and Off -Ice Officials directly, as appropriate, to ensure that any loss of 
time on the game or penalty clocks due to these situations is properly
replaced. (See also Rule 76.8 and Rule 85.7)
In the event of any dispute regarding time, the matter shall be 
referred to the NHL Situation Room for adjustment, and its decision
shall be final. The Game Timekeeper shall assist to verify game time 
via an additional timing device (NHL approved stopwatch).
In the event that a Video Review shows that a goal was scored
prior to the play being stopped, the NHL Situation Room will inform 
the Game Timekeeper and Official Scorer of the time of the goal and 
the amount of playing time left to be re -set on the game clock
and penalty time clocks (if applicable). (See Rule 34.7)
Should the NHL Situation Room be able to determine that a goal 
has been scored through the use of video replay, and play on the ice 
has nonetheless continued, the NHL Situation Room shall instruct th at 
the in -arena horn be sounded to stop play immediately, and the goal 
will be awarded. The game clock (and penalty clocks, if applicable) 
will then be re -set to the time of the goal.
Should the first stoppage of play following an apparent goal 
coincide wi th the end of a period, the On -Ice Official(s) will instruct 
both teams to remain at their respective Player s’Bench until the Video 
Review of the play can be completed.
Rule 3 8–Coach’s Challenge
38.1General -The video review mechanism triggered by the Coach’s
Challenge can only be utilized in GOAL/ NOGOAL situations and is

Rule 3 8 – Coach’s Challenge  
38.1 General - The video review mechanism triggered by the Coach’s 
Challenge can only be utilized in GOAL/ NO GOAL situations and is 
intended to be extremely narrow in scope. In all Coach’s Challenge situations, the original call on the ice will be overturned if, and only if, 
a conclusive and irrefutable determination can be made on the basis of video evidence that the original call on the ice was clearly not SECTION 5 – OFFICIALS 
NATIONAL HOCKEY LEAGUE  OFFICIAL RULES 2021-2022 
64 correct. If a review is not conclusive and/or there is any doubt 
whatsoever as to whether the call on the ice was correct, the original 
call on the ice will be confirmed. 
38.2  Situations Subject to Coach’s Challenge – A team may only 
request a Coach’s Challenge to review the following scenarios: 
(a) “Off-Side” Play Leading to a Goal – A play that results in a
“GOAL” call on the ice where the defending team claims that theplay should have been stopped by reason of an “Off-Side” infraction by the attacking team (see Rule 83 – Off-Side );
(b) Missed Game Stoppage Event in the Offe nsive  Zone 
Leading to a Go al – A play that results in a “GOAL” call on the
ice where the defending team claims that the play should have 
been stopped by reason of any play occurring in the offensive 
zone that should have resulted in a play stoppage caused by the attacking team but did not; and
(c) Scoring Plays Involving Potential “Interference on the 
Goalkeeper” – Either: (i) A play that results in a “GOAL” call on 
the ice where the defending team claims that the goal should 
have been disallowed due to “Interference on the Goalkeeper” 
(as described in Rules 69.1, 69.3 and 69.4); or (ii) A play that 
results in a “ NO GOAL” call on the ice despite the puck having 
entered the net, where the On-Ice Officials have determined that 
the attacking team was guilty of “Interferen ce on the 
Goalkeeper” but where the attacking team claims: (A) there was 
no actual contact of any kind initiated by an attacking Player with
the goalkeeper; (B) the attacking Player was pushed, shoved orfouled by a defending Player which caused the attac king Player 
to come into contact with the goalkeeper; or (C) the attacking 
Player’s positioning within the goal crease did not impair the
goalkeeper’s ability to defend his goal and, in fact, had no 
discernable impact on the play.
38.3 League I nitiated Challenge – In the final minute of play in the 3
rd 
Period and at  any point in Overtime (Regular Season and Playoffs), 
the NHL Situation Room will initiate the review of any scenario that 
would otherwise be subject to a Coach’s  Challenge. 
The NHL Situation Room will continue to be responsible for the 
review of all goals subject to Video Review under Rule 37. Where a 
Coach’s Challenge is available on a scoring play potentially involving 
“Off-Side,” a “Missed Game Stoppage Event in the Offensive Zone” or “Interference on the Goalkeeper,” Hockey Operations will, as an 
initial and threshold matter, determine that the puck entered the net 
legally before the play will be subject to further review by means of a Coach’s Challenge (or, in the final minute of play or in Overtime, a 
review initiated by Hockey Operations). 
If a team requests a Coach’s Challenge but Video Review under 
Rule 37 renders such Challenge unnecessary, then the Challenge will 
have been deemed not to have been made. 
38.4 Process for Initiating a Coach’s Challenge – All Coach’s 
Challenges must be initiated by notice verbally communicated to a SECTION 5 –OFFICIALS
NATIONAL HOCKEY LEAGUE OFFICIAL RULES 20 21-2022
65Referee prior to the center ice face -offfollowing a GOAL or, in the
case of a NOGOAL call by reason of “Interference on the
Goalkee per,” prior to the resumption of play. Teams may not unduly 
delay the resumption of play while evaluating whether or not to initiate 
a Coach’s Challenge. Any such delay or delay tactics may result in the
denial of a right to Challenge and, at the discretio n of the Referee, 
may also result in a minor penalty for “Delaying the Game” under Rule 
63.
In order to expedite the review process, Coaches initiating a
Coach’s Challenge are required to provide to the Referee, with
reasonable specificity, both the reason for their Challenge (i.e., the
actual infraction that is being claimed) and the approximate time on
the clock when the purported infraction transpired. Failure to provide 
this information with reasonable specificity may result in the denial of 
a right to Challenge.
NOTE: Only one Coach’s Challenge per team per stoppage will be 
permitted.
38.5Process for Reviewing a Coach’s Challenge –The League will 
make available in all arenas suitable technology ( for example, a 
handheld tablet or a television or computer monitor) that will allow the
On-Ice Officials, in conjunction with the NHL Situation Room, to 
review video replays of the play giving rise to the Coach’s Challenge
(or, in the final minute of play or in Overtime, the play that caused the
NHL Situation Room to initiate the review). To the extent practical and 
possible, the replays made available to the On -Ice Officials will be the
same replays that are being utilized by the NHL Situation Room.
Once a Coach’s Challenge has been initiat ed (or, in the final 
minute of play or in Overtime, a review is initiated by the NHL 
Situation Room), the NHL Situation Room will immediately establish 
contact with the On -Ice Official(s) responsible for the call (or non -call)
on the ice via the headset and will inquire and discuss with the On -Ice 
Official(s), prior to the On -Ice Official reviewing any video, the
following: ( i) the On -Ice Official’s “final” call on the ice; and ( ii) what 
the On -Ice Official(s) observed on the play.
During all game s (Regular Season and Playoffs), the NHL 
Situation Room will be staffed with at least one retired On -Ice Official
to assist in the review of Coach’s Challenges (including those initiated
by the NHL Situation Room), and such retired Official will be involve d 
both in communicating with the On -Ice Officials via the headset
and with providing input to the Hockey Operations person responsible 
for making the “final” decision by the NHL Situation Room.
The on -ice call will then be reviewed simultaneously by the
appropriate On -IceOfficial(s) at ice level and by the staff in the NHL 
Situation Room using any and all replays at their disposal. After their 
joint review and consultation, the NHL Situation Room will render the
“final” decision on whether to uphold or overturn the original call on
the ice. Once a decision is made, the Referee will inform the Penalty
Timekeeper/Public Address Announcer and will make the 
announcement on the ice.SECTION 5 –OFFICIALS

64correct. If a review is not conclusive and/or there is any doubt 
whatsoever as to whether the call on the ice was correct, the original
call on the ice will be confirmed.
38.2Situations Subject to Coach’s Challenge –A team may only 
request a Coach’s Challenge to review the following scenarios:
(a)“Off-Side” Play Leading to a Goal –A play that results in a
“GOAL” call on the ice where the defending team claims that the
play should have been stopped by reason of an “Off -Side” 
infraction by the attacking team (see Rule 83–Off-Side);
(b)Missed Game Stoppage Event in the Offe nsive  Zone 
Leading to a Go al –A play that results in a “GOAL” call on the
ice where the defending team claims that the play should have 
been stopped by reason of any play occurring in the offensive 
zone that should have resulted in a play stoppage caused by the 
attacking team but did not; and
(c)Scoring Plays Involving Potential “Interference on the 
Goalkeeper” –Either: (i) A play that results in a “GOAL” call on 
the ice where the defending team claims that the goal should 
have been disallowed due to “Interference on the Goalkeeper” 
(as described in Rules 69.1, 69.3 and 69.4); or (ii) A play that 
results in a “ NOGOAL” call on the ice despite the puck having 
entered the net, where the On -Ice Officials have determined that 
the attacking team was guilty of “Interferen ce on the
Goalkeeper” but where the attacking team claims: (A) there was 
no actual contact of any kind initiated by an attacking Player with
the goalkeeper; (B) the attacking Player was pushed, shoved or
fouled by a defending Player which caused the attac king Player 
to come into contact with the goalkeeper; or (C) the attacking 
Player’s positioning within the goal crease did not impair the
goalkeeper’s ability to defend his goal and, in fact, had no 
discernable impact on the play.
38.3League I nitiated Challenge –In the final minute of play in the 3rd
Period and at any point in Overtime (Regular Season and Playoffs), 
the NHL Situation Room will initiate the review of any scenario that 
would otherwise be subject to a Coach’s Challenge.
The NHL Situation Room will continue to be responsible for the
review of all goals subject to Video Review under Rule 37. Where a
Coach’s Challenge is available on a scoring play potentially involving 
“Off-Side,” a “Missed Game Stoppage Event in the Offensive Zone” or 
“Interference on the Goalkeeper,” Hockey Operations will, as an
initial and threshold matter, determine that the puck entered the net 
legally before the play will be subject to further review by means of a 
Coach’s Challenge (or, in the f inalminute of play or in Overtime, a 
review initiated by Hockey Operations).
If a team requests a Coach’s Challenge but Video Review under 
Rule 37renders such Challenge unnecessary, then the Challenge will
have been deemed not to have been made.
38.4Process for Initiating a Coach’s Challenge –All Coach’s 
Challenges must be initiated by notice verbally communicated to a SECTION 5 – OFFICIALS 
NATIONAL HOCKEY LEAGUE  OFFICIAL RULES 2021-2022 
65 Referee prior to the center ice face- off following a GOAL or, in the 
case of a NO GOAL call by reason of “Interference on the 
Goalkeeper,” prior to the resumption of play. Teams may not unduly 
delay the  resumption of play while evaluating whether or not to initiate 
a Coach’s Challenge. Any such delay or delay tactics may result in the denial of a right to Challenge and, at the discretion of the Referee, may also result in a minor penalty for “Delaying the Game”  under Rule 
63. 
In order to expedite the review process, Coaches initiating a 
Coach’s Challenge are  required to provide to the Referee, with 
reasonable specificity, both the reason for their Challenge (i.e., the 
actual infraction that is being claimed) and the approximate time on 
the clock when the purported infraction transpired. Failure to provide 
this information with reasonable specificity may result in the denial of a right to Challenge. 
NOTE:  Only one Coach’s Challenge per team per stoppage will be 
permitted. 
38.5 Process for Reviewing a Coach’s Challenge – The League will 
make  available in all arenas suitable technology ( for example, a 
handheld tablet or a television or computer monitor) that will allow the 
On-Ice Officials, in conjunction with the NHL Situation Room, to 
review video replays of the play giving rise to the Coach’s Challenge 
(or, in the final minute of play or in Overtime, the play that caused the 
NHL Situation Room to initiate the review). To the extent practical and 
possible, the replays made available to the On-Ice Officials will be the 
same replays that are being utilized by the NHL Situation Room.  
Once a Coach’s Challenge has been initiated (or, in the final 
minute of play or in Overtime, a review is initiated by the NHL 
Situation Room), the NHL Situation Room will immediately establish 
contact with the On-Ice Official(s) responsible for the call (or non-call) 
on the ice via the headset and will inquire and discuss with the On-Ice 
Official(s), prior to the On-Ice Official reviewing any video, the 
following: (i) the On-Ice Official’s “final” call on the ice; and ( ii) what 
the On-Ice Official(s) observed on the play. 
During all games (Regular Season and Playoffs), the NHL 
Situation Room will be staffed with at least one retired On-Ice Official 
to assist in the review of Coach’s Challenges (including those initiated 
by the NHL Situation Room), and such retired Official will be involve d 
both in communicating with the On-Ice Officials via the headset 
and with providing input to the Hockey Operations person responsible 
for making the “final” decision by the NHL Situation Room. 
The on-ice call will then be reviewed simultaneously by the 
appropriate On- Ice Official(s) at ice level and by the staff in the NHL 
Situation Room using any and all replays at their disposal. After their 
joint review and consultation, the NHL Situation Room will render the 
“final” decision on whether to uphold or overturn the original call on 
the ice. Once a decision is made, the Referee will inform the Penalty 
Timekeeper/Public Address Announcer and will make the 
announcement on the ice. SECTION 5 – OFFICIALS 
NATIONAL HOCKEY LEAGUE  OFFICIAL RULES 2021-2022 
66 38.6 Right to Initiate a Coach’s Challenge – Teams may initiate a 
Coach’s  Challenge on appropriate plays at any time during the game 
except during the final minute of play in Regulation time or at any time 
during Overtime (Regular Season and Playoffs), at which point the 
exclusive right to initiate a review of any scenario that would otherwise be subject to a Coach’s Challenge shifts to the NHL Situation Room. 
38.7 Results of a Successful Coach’s Challenge – In cases where a 
Challenge has been initiated for an “Off-Side Play Leading to a Goal” 
or a “Missed Game Stoppage Event in the Offensive Zone Leading to a Goal” (either by a team or by the NHL Situation Room), and a 
determination is made that the GOAL call on the ice should be 
overturned, the goal will be disallowed and the clock will be re- set to 
the time at which the play should have been stopped for the missed infraction. In such cases, a face-off will ensue in the ice location where 
it would have otherwise occurred had the on-ice infraction been called 
properly. If one or more penalties (minor or major) are  assessed 
between the time of the missed infraction and the video review that disallows the apparent goal, the offending team(s) (and responsible Player(s)) will still be required to serve the penalty(ies) identified and 
assessed, and the time of the penalty(ies) will be recorded as the time at which the play should have been stopped for the missed infraction. 
In cases where a Challenge has been initiated for a “GOAL” call 
on the ice where the defending team claims that the goal should have 
been disallowed due to the “Interference on the Goalkeeper,” as described in Rules 69.1, 69.3 and 69.4, and a  determination is made 
that the call on the ice should be overturned, the goal will be disallowed and a face-off will ensue in the nearest neutral zone face-
off spot outside the attacking zone. The video review process on 
these plays (whether initiated by way of a Coach’s Challenge or by the 
NHL Situation Room in the final minute of play or in Overtime) will be utilized exclusively for purposes of overturning a “GOAL” call on the 
ice - it will not be utilized for any other purpose, including, specifically, for assessing minor or major penalties for Goalkeeper Interference. 
In cases where a Challenge has been initiated for a “ NO GOAL” 
call on the ice  despite the puck having entered the net, where the On-
Ice Officials have determined that the attacking team was guilty of 
“Interference on the Goalkeeper,” and a determination is made that 
the call on the ice should be overturned, the goal will be allowed and a 
face-off will ensue at center ice. 
38.8 Results of an Unsuccessful Coach’s Challenge – If a team initiates 
a Coach’s Challenge for any of the enumerated scenarios in Rule 38.2 
above and such Challenge does not result in the original call on the 
ice being overturned, the team exercising such Challenge shall be 
assessed a minor penalty (2:00) for delaying the game. 
If a team that has already initiated one or more Challenges that 
were unsuccessful, initiates a Coach’s Challenge for any of the 
enumerated scenarios in Rule 38.2 above  and such Challenge does 
not result in the original call on the ice being overturned, the team SECTION 5 –OFFICIALS

67exercising such Challenge shall be assessed a double -minor penalty 
(4:00) for delaying the game.
38.9Applicable Standards for “Off -Side” Challenge –The standard for 
overturning the call in the event of a “GOAL” call on the ice is that the 
NHL Situation Room, after reviewing any and all available replays and 
consulting with the On -Ice Official(s), determi nes that one or more 
Players on the attacking team preceded the puck into the attacking
zone prior to the goal being scored and that, as a result, the play 
should have been stopped for an “Off -Side” infraction; where this 
standard is met, the goal will be disallowed.
Goals will only be subject to review for a potential “Off -Side”
infraction if the puck does not come out of the attacking zone again 
between the time of the “Off -Side” infraction and the time the goal is 
scored.

Poten tial infractions that would require a play stoppage in the
offensive zone include, but may not be limited to: Hand Pass (Rule
79); High -Sticking the Puck (Rule 80); and Puck Out of Bounds (Rule
85). Such infractions will only serve as a basis for overturning a GOAL 
call on the ice if video review can conclusively establish that a game
stoppage event had occurred in the offensive zone and was missed
by the On -IceOfficial(s). Where the infraction at issue was a missed 
penalty call subject to the judgment or discretion of the On -Ice 
Official(s), such infraction cannot result in the “GOAL” call on the ice
being overturned, even if upon review, the On -Ice Official(s) would 
have made a different call.
Goals will only be reviewed for a potential “Missed G ame 
Stoppage Event in the Offensive Zone” if the puck does not come out 
of the attacking zone again between the time of the “Missed Game

87Rule 56–Interference
56.1Interference -A strict standard on acts of interference must be
adhered to in all areas of the rink.
Body Position: Body position shall be determined as the player 
skating in front of or beside his opponent, traveling in 
the same direction. A player who is behind an 
opponent, who does not have the puck, may not use
his stick, body or free hand in or der to restrain his
opponent, but must skate in order to gain or 
reestablish his proper position in order to make a 
check.
A player is allowed the ice he is standing on
(body position) and is not required to move in order 
to let an opponent proceed. A pla yer may “block” the
path of an opponent provided he is in front of his 
opponent and moving in the same direction. Moving
laterally and without establishing body position, then 
making contact with the non -puck carrier is not 
permitted and will be penalized as interference. A 
player is always entitled to use his body position to 
lengthen an opponent’s path to the puck, provided
his stick is not utilized (to make himself “bigger” and 
therefore considerably lengthening the distance his 
opponent must travel to g et where he is going); his
free hand is not used and he does not take 
advantage of his body position to deliver an 
otherwise illegal check.
Possession of the Puck:
The last player to touch the puck, other than the
goalkeeper, shall be considered the playe r in
possession. The player deemed in possession of the
puck may be checked legally, provided the check is 
rendered immediately following his loss of 
possession.

87 Rule 56 – Interference 
56.1 Interference  - A strict standard on acts of interference must be 
adhered to in all areas of the rink. 
Body Position: Body position shall be determined as the player 
skating in front of or beside his opponent, traveling in 
the same direction. A player who is behind an 
opponent, who does not have the puck, may not use 
his stick, body or free hand in order to restrain his opponent, but must skate in order to gain or 
reestablish his proper position in order to make a check.  
A player is allowed the ice he is standing on 
(body position) and is not required to move in order 
to let an opponent proceed. A player may “block” the path of an opponent provided he is in front of his 
opponent and moving in the same direction. Moving 
laterally and without establishing body position, then making contact with the non-puck carrier is not 
permitted and will be penalized as interference. A 
player is always entitled to use his body position to lengthen an opponent’s path to the puck, provided 
his stick is not utilized (to make himself “bigger” and 
therefore considerably lengthening the distance his 
opponent must travel to g et where he is going); his 
free hand is not used and he does not take advantage of his body position to deliver an 
otherwise illegal check. 
Possession of the Puck:  
The last player to touch the puck, other than the 
goalkeeper, shall be considered the playe r in 
possession. The player deemed in possession of the puck may be checked legally, provided the check is rendered immediately following his loss of 
possession. 
Restrain: The actions of a player who does not have body 
position, but instead uses illegal means (e.g. hook 
with stick; hold with hands, trip with the stick or in any 
manner) to impede an opponent who is not in possession of the puck. Illegal means are acts which 
allow a player or goalkeeper to establish, maintain or restore body position other than by skating. 
Pick: A “pick” is the action of a player who checks an 
opponent who is not in possession of the puck and is 
unaware of the impending check/hit. A player who is 
aware of an impending hit, not deemed to be a legal 
“battle for the puck,” may not be interfered with by a 
player or goalkeeper delivering a “pick.” A player 
delivering a “pick” is one who moves into an 
opponent’s path without initially having body position, SECTION 7 – RESTRAINING FOULS

an interference penalty shall be assessed. 
Free Hand: When a free hand is used to hold, pull, tug, grab or 
physically restrain an opponent from moving freely,

may be used by a player to “fend off” an opponent or his stick, but may not be used to hold an opponent’s 
stick or body. 
Stick: A player who does not have body position on his

judgment of the Referee.

hand, or prevents a player who has dropped his stick or any other piece of equipment from regaining possession of it (see Rule 53.2(iii) );

the location where the play was stopped, unless it is in the non -
offending team’s defending zone, and as such the ensuing face -off 
would be outside the blue line at one of the face -offspots in the

68.1 Illegal Substitution  – An illegal substitution shall be deemed to have 
occurred when a player enters the game illegally from either the 
players’ bench (teammate not within the five (5) foot limit, refer to Rule 
74 – Too Many Men on the Ice), from the penalty bench (penalty ha s 
not yet expired), when a major penalty is being served and the 
replacement player does not return to the ice from the penalty bench 
(see 68.2), or when a player illegally enters the game for the sole 
purpose of preventing an opposing player from scoring on a breakaway (see 68.3 and 68.4). 
When an injured player is penalized and leaves the game, if he 
returns before the expiration of his penalty, he is not eligible to play.  
This includes coincidental penalties when his substitute is still in the 
penalty b ox awaiting a stoppage in play.  The injured player must wait 
until his substitute has been released from the penalty box before he is eligible to play.  See 8.1. 
68.2 Bench Minor Penalty  – When a player receives a major penalty and 
a misconduct or game misconduct penalty at the same time, or when 
an injured player receives a major penalty and is unable to serve the 
penalty himself, the penalized team shall place a substitute player on 
the penalty bench before the major penalty expires and no replacement for the  penalized player shall be permitted to enter the 
game except from the penalty bench. Any violation of this provision shall be treated as an illegal substitution under this rule calling for a 
bench minor penalty. 
68.3 Penalty Shot  – If a player of the attacking side in possession of the 
puck shall be in such a position as to have no opposition between him 
and the opposing goalkeeper, and while in such position he shall be 
interfered with by a player of the opposing side who shall have illegally 
entered the game, the Referee shall impose a penalty shot against the 
side to which the offending player belongs. 
68.4 Awarded Goal  - If, when the opposing goalkeeper has been removed 
from the ice, a player of the side attacking the unattended goal is 
interfered with in the neutral or attacking zone by a player who shall 
have entered the game illegally, the Referee shall immediately award a goal to the non-offending team. 
68.5 Disallowed Goal – If a penalized player returns to the ice from the 
penalty bench before his penalty has expired by his own error or the 
error of the Penalty Timekeeper, any goal scored by his own team while he (or his substitute) is illegally on the ice shall be disallowed but 
all penalties imposed on either team shall be served as regular 
penalties.  The penalized player must return to serve his unexpired time (and an additional minor penalty if he left the penalty bench on 
his own).

Rule 69–Interference on the Goalkeeper
69.1 Interference on the Goalkeeper -This rule is based on the premise
that an attacking player’s position, whether inside or outside the 
crease, should not, by itself, determine whether a goal should be
allowed or disallowed. In other words, goals scored while attacking 
players are standing in the crease may, in appropriate circumstances 
be allowed. Goals should be disallowed only if:  (1) an attacking 
player, either by his positioning or by contact, impairs the goalkeeper’s
ability to move freely within his crease or defend his goal; or (2) an 
attacking player initiates intentional or deliber atecontact with a 
goalkeeper, inside or outside of his goal crease. Incidental contact 
with a goalkeeper will be permitted, and resulting goals allowed, when 
such contact is initiated outside of the goal crease, provided the
attacking player has made a re asonable effort to avoid such contact. 
The rule will be enforced exclusively in accordance with the on -ice 
judgement of the Referee(s), but may be subject to a Coach’s
Challenge (see Rule 38).
For purposes of this rule, “contact,” whether incidental or 
otherwise, shall mean any contact that is made between or among a
goalkeeper and attacking player(s), whether by means of a stick or 
any part of the body.
The overriding rationale of this rule is that a goalkeeper should 
have the ability to m ove freely within his goal crease without being
hindered by the actions of an attacking player. If an attacking player 
enters the goal crease and, by his actions, impairs the goalkeeper’s
ability to defend his goal, and a goal is scored, the goal will be 
disallowed.
If an attacking player has been pushed, shoved, or fouled by a 
defending player so as to cause him to come into contact with the
goalkeeper, such contact will not be deemed contact initiated by the 
attacking player for purposes of this rule, pro vided the attacking player
has made a reasonable effort to avoid such contact.
If a defending player has been pushed, shoved, or fouled by an 
attacking player so as to cause the defending player to come into 
contact with his own goalkeeper, such contact sh all be deemed
contact initiated by the attacking player for purposes of this rule, and if 
necessary a penalty assessed to the attacking player and if a goal is 
scored it would be disallowed.
69.2Penalty -In all cases in which an attacking player initia tes intentional 
or deliberate contact with a goalkeeper, whether or not the goalkeeper 
is inside or outside the goal crease , and whether or not a goal is 
scored, the attacking player will receive a penalty (minor or major, as
the Referee deems appropriate) . In all cases where the infraction
being imposed is to the attacking player for hindering the goalkeeper’s
ability to move freely in his goal crease, the penalty to be assessed is
for goalkeeper interference.SECTION 9 –OTHER FOULS

(see 68.2), or when a player illegally enters the game for the sole

When an injured player is penalized and leaves the game, if he

This includes coincidental penalties when his substitute is still in the

68.2 Bench Minor Penalty –When a player receives a major penalty and
a misconduct or game miscond uct penalty at the same time, or when 
an injured player receives a major penalty and is unable to serve the 
penalty himself, the penalized team shall place a substitute player on
the penalty bench before the major penalty expires and no

entered the game, the Referee shall impose a penalty shot against the
side to which the offending player belongs.

interfered with in the neutral or attacking zone by a player who shall
have entered the game illegally, the Referee shall immediately a ward 
a goal to the non -offending team.

players are standing in the crease may, in appropriate circumstances

goalkeeper, inside or outside of his goal crease. Incidental contact with a goalkeeper will be permitted, and resulting goals allowed, when such contact is initiated outside of the goal crease, provided the 
attacking player has made a reasonable effort to avoid such contact. 
The rule will be enforced exclusively in accordance with the on-ice judgement of the Referee(s), but may be subject to a Coach’s 
Challenge (see Rule 38). 
For purposes of this rule, “contact,” whether incidental or 
otherwise, shall mean any contact that is made between or among a 
goalkeeper and attacking player(s), whether by means of a stick or 
any part of the body. 
The overriding rationale of this rule  is that a goalkeeper should 
have the ability to move freely within his goal crease without being 
hindered by the actions of an attacking player. If an attacking player enters the goal crease and, by his actions, impairs the goalkeeper’s 
ability to defend his goal, and a goal is scored, the goal will be disallowed.

69.2 Penalty  - In all cases in which an attacking player initiates intentional 
or deliberate contact with a goalkeeper, whether or not the goalkeeper 
is inside or outside the goal crease, and whether or not a goal is 
scored, the attacking player will receive a penalty (minor or major, as the Referee deems appropriate). In all cases where the infraction 
being imposed is to the attacking player for hindering the goalkeeper’s

for goalkeeper interference.  SECTION 9 – OTHER FOULS

102 In exercising his judgment, the Referee should give more 
significant consideration to the degree and nature of the contact with 
the goalkeeper than to the exact location of the goalkeeper at the time of the contact. 
69.3 Contact Inside the Goal Crease  - If an attacking player initiates 
contact with a goalkeeper, incidental or otherwise, while the 
goalkeeper is in his goal crease, and a goal is scored, the goal will be 
disallowed. 
If a goalkeeper, in the act of establishing his position within his 
goal crease, initiates contact with an attacking player who i s in the 
goal crease, and this results in an impairment of the goalkeeper’s ability to defend his goal, and a goal is scored, the goal will be 
disallowed. 
If, after any contact by a goalkeeper who is attempting to establish 
position in his goal crease, the attacking player does not immediately 
vacate his current position in the goal crease (i.e. give ground to the goalkeeper), and a goal is scored, the goal will be disallowed. In all 
such cases, whether or not a goal is scored, the attacking player will receive a minor penalty for goalkeeper interference. 
If an attacking player establishes a significant position within the 
goal crease, so as to obstruct the goalkeeper’s vision and impair his 
ability to defend his goal, and a goal is scored, the go al will be 
disallowed. 
For this purpose, a player “establishes a significant position within 
the crease” when, in the Referee’s judgment, his body, or a substantial portion thereof, is within the goal crease for more than an 
instantaneous period of time. 
Refer also to Reference Tables –  Table 16 – Interference on the 
Goalkeeper Situations (page 154 ). 
69.4 Contact Outside the Goal Crease  - If an attacking player initiates 
any contact with a goalkeeper, other than incidental contact, while the 
goalkeeper is outside his goal crease, and a goal is scored, the goal will be disallowed.  
A goalkeeper is not “fair game” just because he is outsid e the goal 
crease. The appropriate penalty should be assessed in every case 
where an attacking player makes unnecessary contact with the goalkeeper. However, incidental contact will be permitted when the 
goalkeeper is in the act of playing the puck outside his goal crease 
provided the attacking player has made a reasonable effort to avoid 
such unnecessary contact.  
When a goalkeeper has played the puck outside of his crease and 
is then prevented from returning to his crease area due to the 
deliberate actions of an attacking player, such player may be 
penalized for goalkeeper interference. Similarly, the goalkeeper may 
be penalized, if by his actions outside of his crease he deliberately interferes with an attacking player who is attempting to play the puck 
or an opponent.

scored as a result thereof will be allowed.

goal will be disallowed. If applicable, appropriate penalties wi ll be
assessed.  If, however, in the opinion of the Referee, the attacking

the goalkeeper to be pushed into the net together with the puck, the
goal can be permitted.
In the event that the puck is under a player in or around the crease

ability to defend his goal, and a goal is scored, the go al will be 
disallowed.
For this purpose, a player “establishes a significant position within 
the crease” when, in the Referee’s judgment, his body, or a 
substantial portion thereof, is within the goal crease for more than an
instantaneous period of time.
Refer als o to Reference Tables –Table 16 –Interference on the
Goalkeeper Situations (page 1 54).
69.4Contact Outside the Goal Crease -If an attacking player initiates
any contact with a goalkeeper, other than incidental contact, while the 
goalkeeper is outside his goal crease, and a goal is scored, the goal 
will be disallowed. 
A goalkeeper is not “fair game” just because he is outsid e the goal
crease. The appropriate penalty should be assessed in every case 
where an attacking player makes unnecessary contact with the
goalkeeper. However, incidental contact will be permitted when the 
goalkeeper is in the act of playing the puck outside his goal crease
provided the attacking player has made a reasonable effort to avoid 
such unnecessary contact.
When a goalkeeper has played the puck outside of his crease and 
is then prevented from returning to his crease area due to the
deliberate actions of an attacking player, such player may be
penalized for goalkeeper interference. Similarly, the goalkeeper may
be penalized, if by his actions outside of his crease he deliberately 
interferes with an attacking player who is attempting to play the puck 
oran opponent.

goalkeeper and attacking player(s) are simultaneously attempting to

contact with the goalkeeper will be permitted, and any goal that is scored as a result thereof will be allowed. 
In the event that a goalkeeper has been pushed into the net 
together with the puck by an attacking player after making a stop, the 
goal will be disallowed. If applicable, appropriate penalties wi ll be 
assessed.  If, however, in the opinion of the Referee, the attacking 
player was pushed or otherwise fouled by a defending player causing 
the goalkeeper to be pushed into the net together with the puck, the 
goal can be permitted. 
In the event that the  puck is under a player in or around the crease 
area (deliberately or otherwise), a goal cannot be scored by pushing

Delaying the Game). 
69.8 Fines and Suspensions  - An attacking player who, in the judgment

batting, kicking or high -sticking the puck into the goal, the resulting 
face-off shall take place in the neutral zone at the nearest face-off 
spot. 
When the game is stopped for any reason not specifically covered 
in the official rules, the puck must be faced- off at  a face-off spot in the 
zone nearest to where it was last played. 
Following a stoppage of play, should one or both defensemen who 
are the point players or any player coming from the bench of the 
attacking team, enter into the attacking zone beyond the oute r edge of 
the end zone face-off circle during an altercation, gathering or 
“scrum,” the ensuing face-off shall take place in the neutral zone near 
the blue line of the defending team. This rule also applies when an 
icing, an intentional off -side, or a penalty has been assessed, and the 
ensuing face-off is to be in the offending team’s defending zone. 
Should any of the non-offending players enter into the attacking zone 
beyond the outer edge of the end zone face- off circle during an 
altercation, gathering or  “scrum,” the ensuing face-off shall take place 
in the neutral zone near the blue line of the defending team.  
For a violation of  Rule 71 – Premature Substitution, the resulting

face-off spot in the zone where the play was stopped. 
When play is stopped for an injured player, the ensuing face-off 
shall be conducted at the face-off spot in the zone nearest the location 
of the puck when the play was stopped.  When the injured player’s

neutral zone.  When the injured player is in his defending zone and 
the attacking team is in control of the puck in the attacking zone, the face-off shall be conducted at one of the defending team’s end-zone 
face- off spots . 
76.3 Procedure –  As soon as the line change procedure has been 
completed by the Referee and he lowers his hand to indicate no 
further changes, the Linesman conducting the face-off shall blow his 
whistle. This will signal to both teams that they have no more than five (5) seconds to line up for the ensuing face-off. At the end of the five 
(5) seconds (or sooner if both centers are ready), the Linesman will conduct a proper face-off. If, however: 
(i) One or both centers are not positioned for the face- off, 
(ii) One or both centers refrain from placing their stick on the ice, 
(iii) Any player has encroached into the face- off circle, 
(iv) Any player makes physical contact with an opponent, or

his attempt to conduct a fast and fair face -off.
76.4Procedure –Centers –The puck shall be faced -off by the Referee or
the Linesman dropping the puck on the ice between the sticks of the
players facing -off. Players facing -off will stand squarely facing their 
opponent’s end of the rink approximately one stick length apart wit h 
the blade of their sticks on the ice.
When the face -off takes place atany of the nine face-off spots , the
players taking part shall take their position so that they will stand
squarely facing their opponent’s end of the rink, and clear of the ice

second time limit has elapsed, the Linesman will drop the puck 
immediately. If the center is back from the face -off spot, is 
“quarterbacking” or refuses to come into the face -off area whe n 
instructed to do so by the Linesman, or the center is simply slow 
getting to the face -off spot when the five (5) seconds has elapsed, the
puck shall be dropped. If the center attempts to arrive at the face -off 
spot just as the five seconds elapses in an attempt to gain an
advantage to win the face -off, he is to be removed from the face -off 
and replaced, resulting in a face -off violation. If the face -off is a result 
of an icing infraction and the center attempts to arrive at the face -off 
spot just as the five seconds elapse to gain an advantage to win the
face-off, he shall not be removed from the face -off. The center will be
warned by the Linesman that he has committed a face -off violation.  In 
the even the center then comits a second face -off violation or the
action actually is the second face -off violation, a bench minor penalty 
shall be assessed.
If a player is ejected from the face -off, his replacement must come 
into position quickly or risk having the puck dropped by the Linesman
without the player b eing set, or ejected from the face -off by the
Linesman resulting in a bench minor penalty for delay of game for a
second face -off violation during the same face -off.
When a team commits an icing infraction, any face -off violation will 
not result in the c enter being removed.  The center will be warned by

During end-zone face-offs, all other players on the ice must 
position their bodies on their own side of the restraining lines mar ked 
on the outer edge of the face- off circles.  
If a player other than the player taking the face-off moves into the 
face-off circle prior to the dropping of the puck, then the offending 
team’s player taking the face-off shall be ejected from the face-off 
circle. This shall be considered a face- off violation.  
Players on the attacking team (exclusive of the center) must 
establish their position first and then the defending team may counter 
and hold its position until the puck is dropped. A violation of this 
procedure shall be treated as face- off encroachment and the 
Linesman shall order the center of the offending team replaced. 
Should an attacking player attempt to establish a new position prior to 
the face-off, and the defending center steps back from the fa ce-off 
spot in order to reposition his teammates, the face- off violation shall 
be charged to the attacking team as they must establish their position 
first.  
76.6 Violations  – If a center should move prematurely prior to the face-off, 
or if the Referee or Linesman shall have dropped the puck unfairly, 
the face-off shall be considered a face-off violation and it must be 
conducted again. 
When a least two face-off violations have been committed by the 
same team during the same face-off, this team shall be penalized with 
a bench minor penalty to the offending team. This penalty shall be 
announced as a “Bench Minor Penalty for Delay of Game –  Face-off 
Violation.”   
Face-off violations shall be summarized as follows (any of the four 
on-ice officials may identify a face- off violation):  
(i) Encroachment by any player other than the center into the face -off 
area prior to the puck being dropped. Players on the perimeter of the 
face-off circle must keep both skates outside the face-off circle (skate 
contact with the line is permitted). If a player's skate crosses the line 
into the face -off circle prior to the drop of the puck, this shall be 
deemed as a face- off violation.  A player's stick may be inside the 
face-off circle provided there is no physical contact with his opponent 
or his opponent's stick.  
(ii) Encroachment by any player into the area between the hash marks 
on the outer edges of the face-off circle prior to the puck being dropped. Players must also ensure that both of their skates do not 
cross their respecti ve hash marks. Contact with the line with their 
skate is permitted. If a player's skate crosses the line into the area 
between the hash marks prior to the drop of the puck, this shall be 
deemed as a face- off violation.  A player's stick may be inside the 
area between the hash marks provided there is no physical contact 
with his opponent or his opponent's stick.  
(iii) Any physical contact with an opponent prior to the puck being 
dropped. 
(iv) Failure by either center taking the face-off to properly position himself SECTION 10 –GAME FLOW
NATIONAL HOCKEY LEAGUE OFFICIAL RULES 20 21-2022
117behind the restraining lines or place his stick on the ice (as outlined in 
Rule76.4). "Properly position himself behind the restraining lines"
shall mean that the center must place his feet on either side of the 
restraining lines that are parallel to the sid e boards (contact with the 
lines is permissible), and the toe of the blade of his skates must not 
cross over the restraining lines that are perpendicular to the side 
boards as he approaches the face -off spot.
The blade of the stick must then be placed on t he ice (at least the 
toe of the blade of the stick) in the designated white area of the face -
off spot and must remain there until the puck is dropped.
Failure to comply with this positioning and face -off procedure will
result in a face -off violation.
Whene ver a team has committed two face -off violations during the
same face -off, the Referee shall immediately assess the offending 
team a bench minor penalty for delay of game. This penalty shall be
announced as a “Bench Minor Penalty for Delay of Game –Face -off 
Violation.”
Players who are late to the face -off location and therefore in an off -
side position for the ensuing face -off will be warned once in the game
by the Referee. This warning will also be given to the offending team’s 
Coach.  In this situation, t he offending team’s center is not ejected
from the face -off.  Any subsequent violation shall result in a bench 
minor penalty for delay of game being assessed to the offending 
team. This penalty shall be announced as a “Bench Minor Penalty for
Delay of Game –Slow Proceeding to Face -off Location.”

on the playing surface, no player facing -off shall make any physical
contact with his opponent’s body by means of his own body or by his 
stick ex cept in the course of playing the puck after the face -off has 
been completed.
For violation of this rule, the Referee may, at his discretion impose
a minor penalty or penalties on the player(s) whose action(s) caused 
the physical contact. Nonetheless, this physical contact prior to the 
dropping of the puck shall be deemed as a face -off violation and the
Linesman shall order the center of the offending team replaced.
Face -off encroachment may be applied during face -offs at any of 
the nine (9) face -off spots on the playing surface. However, since no 
such lines are painted on the ice at the four (4) face -off spots adjacent 
to the blue lines, Linesmen shall use their judgment as to whether or
not a violation has occurred. All players, other than the centers, sha ll 
be uniformly back from the face -off location similar to being outside
the face -off circle for face -offs in the end zones.
76.7Line Changes –No substitution of players shall be permitted until the
face-off has been completed and play has resumed excep t when a 
penalty is imposed which affects the on -ice strength of either team.
Should an on -ice official notice that the defending team has not 
placed enough players on the ice for the ensuing face -off, the Referee 
in the neutral zone shall be notified and he will instruct the offending
team to place another player(s) on the ice. If, in the opinion of the
Referee that this is being done as a stalling tactic, he will issue a 
warning to the offending team’s Coach and any subsequent violations SECTION 10 –GAME FLOW

when at least a portion of the flexible peg(s) are still inside both the
goal post and the hole in the ice. The flexi ble pegs could be bent, but 
as long as at least a portion of the flexible peg(s) are still in the hole in 
the ice and the goal post, the goal frame shall be deemed to be in its 
proper position. The goal frame could be raised somewhat on one
post (or both), but as long as the flexible pegs are still in contact with
the holes in the ice and the goal posts, the goal frame shall not be 
deemed to be displaced. 
A goal shall be scored if the puck is shot into the goal by a player 
of the defending side. The player of the attacking side who last 
touched the puck shall be credited with the goal but no assist shall be
awarded.
A goal shall be scored if the puck is put into the goal in any other
manner by a player of the defending side.  The player of the attacking 
side who last touched the puck shall be credited with the goal and 
assists may be awarded.
If an attacking player has the puck deflect into the net, off his skate 
or body, in any manner, the goal shall be allowed. The player who 
deflected the puck shall be cr edited with the goal.SECTION 10 –GAME FLOW

118shall result in t he assessment of a bench minor penalty for delay of 
game. 
Should an on -ice official notice that the attacking team has not 
placed enough players on the ice for the ensuing face -off, the
Linesman will proceed with conducting the face -off in the normal 
mann er. The attacking team must ensure they put the appropriate 
number of players on the ice at all times. 
76.8 Verification of Time -Any loss of time on the game or penalty clocks 
due to a false face -off or face -off violation must be replaced. The
Video Goal Jud ge may be consulted to ensure the time is accurately
replaced.
The whistle will not be blown by the official to start play. Playing 
time will commence from the instant the puck is faced -off and will stop
when the whistle is blown or a goal is scored.
Rule 7 7–Game and Intermission Timing
77.1 Game Timing –The time allowed for a game shall be three (3)
twenty -minute periods of actual play with a rest intermission between
periods.
77.2 Intermission Timing –Play shall be resumed promptly following 
each intermission upon the expiration of eight een (1 8) minutes o r a 
length of time designated by the League from the completion of play in
the preceding period. Timing of the intermission commences once the
last official exits the ice surface upon the termination of the peri od. 
(See Rule 34–Game Timekeeper.)  
For the purpose of keeping the spectators informed as to the time 
remaining during intermissions, the Game Timekeeper will use the 
electronic clock to record length of intermissions.
77.3 Delays -If any unusual delay occurs within five (5) minutes of the end
of the first or sec ond periods, the Referee may order the next regular 
intermission to be taken immediately. The balance of the period will be 
completed on the resumption of play with the teams defending the
same goals after which the teams will change ends and resume play 
of the ensuing period without delay.
If a delay takes place with more than five (5) minutes remaining in 
the first or second period, the Referee will order the next regular 
intermission to be taken immediately only when requested to do so by 
the home Club.
Rule 78–Goals
78.1Goals and Assists -It is the responsibility of the Official Scorer to 
award goals and assists, and his decision in this respect is final, 
notwithstanding the report of the Referee or any other game official. 
The use of video replay to verify the proper awarding of a goal or an 
assist is essential. Such awards shall be made or withheld strictly in
accordance with the provisions of this rule. Therefore, it is essential 
that the Official Scorer be thoroughly familiar with every aspect of this 
rule; be alert to observe all action s which could affect the awarding of SECTION 10 – GAME FLOW 
NATIONAL HOCKEY LEAGUE  OFFICIAL RULES 20 21-2022 
119 a goal or assist; and, above all, give or withhold awards with absolute 
impartiality. 
In case of an obvious error in awarding a goal or an assist that has 
been announced, it should be corrected promptly, but changes should 
not be made in the official scoring summary after the Referee has 
signed the game report (except by the League’s Chief Statistician). 
The team scoring the greatest number of goals during the three (3) 
twenty-minute periods shall be the winner and shall be credited with 
two points in the League standings. In the event a winner during the 
regular season is determined in the overtime period or the shootout, 
the winning team shall be credited with two points in the League standings and the losing team will be credited with one point in the 
League standings. 
78.2 Crediting Goals  - A “goal” shall be credited in the scoring records to 
a player who shall have propelled the puck into the opponent’s goal. 
Each “goal” shall count one point in the player’s record. Only one point can be credited to any one player on a goal. 
78.3 Crediting Assists  - When a player scores a goal, an “assist” shall be 
credited to the player or players (maximum two) who touch the puck 
prior to the goal scorer provided no defender plays or has control of the puck subsequently. Each “assist” shall count one point in the 
player’s record. Only one point can be credited to any one player on a 
goal. 
78.4 Scoring a Goal  - A goal shall be scored when the puck shall have 
been put between the goal posts by the stick of a player of the 
attacking side, from in front and below the crossbar, and entirely across a red line the width of the diameter of the goal posts drawn on 
the ice from one goal post to the other with the goal frame in its proper 
position. The goal frame shall be considered in its proper position 
when at least a portion of the flexible peg(s) are still inside both the 
goal post and the hole in the ice. The flexible pegs could be bent, but as long as at least a portion of the flexible peg(s) are still in the hole in 
the ice and the goal post, the goal frame shall be deemed to be in its 
proper position. The goal frame could be raised somewhat on one 
post (or both), but as long as the flexible pegs are still in contact with 
the holes in the ice and the goal posts, the goal frame shall not be deemed to be displaced.  
A goal shall be scored if the puck is shot into the goal by a player 
of the defending side. The player of the attacking side who last 
touched the puck shall be credited with the goal but no assist shall be 
awarded. 
A goal shall be scored if the puck is put into the goal in any other 
manner by a player of the defending side.  The player of the attacking 
side who last touched the puck shall be credited with the goal and 
assists may be awarded. 
If an attacking player has the puck deflect into the net, off his skate 
or body, in any manner, the goal shall be allowed. The player who 
deflected the puck shall be credited with the goal. SECTION 10 – GAME FLOW 
NATIONAL HOCKEY LEAGUE  OFFICIAL RULES 20 21-2022 
120 Should a player legally propel a puck into the goal crease of the 
opponent Club and the puck should become loose and available to 
another player of the attacking side, a goal scored on the play shall be 
legal. 
78.5 Disallowed Goals  – Apparent goals shall be disallowed by the 
Referee and the appropriate announcement made by the Public Address Announcer for the following reasons: 
(i) When the puck has been directed, batted or thrown into the net by an 
attacking player other than with a stick.   When this occurs, if it is 
deemed to be done deliberately, then the decision shall be NO 
GOAL.  A goal cannot be scored when the puck has been deliberately 
batted with any part of the attacking player’s body into the net.  
(ii) When the puck has been kicked using a distinct kicking motion.
(iii) When the puck has deflected directly into the net off an official.
(iv) When a goal has been scored and an ineligible player is on the ice.
(v) When an attacking player has interfered with a goalkeeper in his goal
crease. 
(vi) When the puck ha s entered the net after making contact with an 
attacking player’s stick that is above the height of the crossbar.
Where the puck makes contact with the stick is the determining 
factor.  See 38.4(vi) .
(vii) When video review confirms the scoring of a goal at one end of the 
ice, any goal scored at the other end on the same play must be 
disallowed. 
(viii) When a Linesman reports a double- minor penalty for high -sticking, a 
major penalty or a match penalty to the Referee following the scoring 
of a goal by the offending team, the goal must be disallowed and the 
appropriate penalty assessed.  
(ix) When a goalkeeper has been pushed into the net together with the 
puck after making a save.  See also 69.7.
(x) When the net becomes displaced accidentally. The goal frame is 
considered to b e displaced if either or both goal pegs are no longer in 
their respective holes in the ice, or the net has come completely off one or both pegs, prior to or as the puck enters the goal. 
(xi) During the delayed calling of a penalty, the offending team cannot 
score unless the non -offending team shoots the puck into their own 
net. This shall mean that a deflection off an offending player or any physical action by an offending player that may cause the puck to enter the non -offending team’s goal, shall not be considered a legal 
goal. Play shall be stopped before the puck enters the net (whenever possible) and the signaled penalty assessed to the offending team. 
(xii) When the Referee deems the play has been stopped, even if he had 
not physically had the opportunity to stop play by blowing his whistle.
(xiii) Any goal scored, other than as covered by the official rules, shall not be allowed. 
78.6 League Initiated Review  - In the final minute of play in the 3rd period 
and at any point in Overtime (Regular Season and Playoffs), Hockey 
Operations will initiate the review of any scenario that would otherwise 
be subject to a Coach’s Challenge. 
Hockey Operations will continue to initiate and be responsible for 
the review of all goals subject to Video Review under Rule 37.3. 
Where a Coach’s Challenge is available on a scoring play potentially SECTION 10 –GAME FLOW
NATIONAL HOCKEY LEAGUE OFFICIAL RULES 20 21-2022
121involving “Interference on the Goalkeeper” , “Missed Game Stoppage 
Event in the Offensive Zone Leading to a Goal”, or “Off -side,” Hockey 
Operations will, as an initial and threshold matter, determine that the
puck entered the net and is a good hockey goal before the play will be
subject to further review by means of a Coach’s Challenge (or, in the
final minute of play or in Overtime, a review initiated by Hockey 
Operations). If a team requests a Coach’s Challenge but Video
Review under Rule 37.3 renders such Challenge unnecessary, then 
the Challenge will be deemed not to have been made .
Rule 79–Hand Pass
79.1 Hand Pass -A player shall be permitted to stop or “bat” a puck in the 
air with his open hand, or push it along the ice with his hand, and the 
play shall not be stopped unless, in the opinion of the on -ice officials, 
he has directed the puck to a teammate, or has a llowed his team to 
gain an advantage, and subsequently possession and control of the
puck is obtained by a player of the offending team, either directly or 
deflected off any player or official.
For violations related to “closing his hand on the puck”, refe r to 
Rule 67–Handling Puck.
79.2Defending Zone -Play will not be stopped for any hand pass by
players in their own defending zone. The location of the puck when
contacted by either the player making the hand pass or the player
receiving the hand pass shall determine the zone it is in.
79.3 Face -Off Location –When a hand pass violation has occurred, the
ensuing face -off shall take place at the nearest face -off spot in the
zone where the offense occurred, unless the offending team gains a 
territorial advantage, then the face -off shall be at t he nearest face -off 
spot in the zone where the stoppage of play occurred, unless 
otherwise covered in the rules. When a hand pass violation occurs by
a team in their attacking zone, the ensuing face -off shall be conducted 
at one of the face -off spots outsi de the defending team’s blue line in 
the neutral zone.
Rule 80–High -sticking the Puck
80.1 High -sticking the Puck –For infractions involving high -sticks, refer to 
Rule 60 –High-sticking.
Batting the puck above the normal height of the shoulders with 
a stick is prohibited. When a puck is struck with a high stick and 
subsequently comes into the possession and control of a player from 
the offending team (including the player who made contact with the
puck), either directly or deflected off any player or official, there shall 
be a whistle.
When a puck has been contacted by a high stick, the play shall 
be permitted to continue, provided that: 
(i) the puck has been batted to an opponent (when a play er bats the 
puck to an opponent, the Referee shall give the “washout” signal
immediately. Otherwise, he will stop the play).SECTION 10 –GAME FLOW
NATIONAL HOCKEY LEAGUE OFFICIAL RULES 20 21-2022
120Should a player legally propel a puck into the goal crease of the
opponent Club and the puck should become loose and available to 
another player of the attacking side, a goal scored on the play shall be
legal.
78.5 Disallowed Goals –Appar ent goals shall be disallowed by the
Referee and the appropriate announcement made by the Public 
Address Announcer for the following reasons:
(i) When the puck has been directed, batted or thrown into the net by an

(vii) When video review confirms the scoring of a goal at one end of the 
ice, any goal scored at the other end on the same play must be 
disallowed.
(viii) When a Linesman reports a double -minor penalty for high -sticking, a 
major penalty or a match penalty to the Referee following the scoring 
of a goal by the offending t eam, the goal must be disallowed and the 
appropriate penalty assessed.

their respective holes in the ice, or the net has come completely off
one or both pegs, prior to or as the puck enters the goal.
(xi) During the delayed calling of a penalty, the offending team cannot 
score unless the non -offending team shoots the puck into their own

and at any point in Overtime (Regular Season and Playoffs), Hockey 
Operations will initiate the review of any scenario that would otherwise 
be subject to a Coach’s Challenge.
Hockey Operations will continue to initiate and be responsible for
the re view of all goals subject to Video Review under Rule 37.3. 
Where a Coach’s Challenge is available on a scoring play potentially SECTION 10 – GAME FLOW 
NATIONAL HOCKEY LEAGUE  OFFICIAL RULES 20 21-2022 
121 involving “Interference on the Goalkeeper” , “Missed  Game Stoppage 
Event in the Offensive Zone Leading to a Goal”, or “Off-side,” Hockey 
Operations will, as an initial and threshold matter, determine that the

Rule 79 – Hand Pass 
79.1 Hand Pass  - A player shall be permitted to stop or “bat” a puck in the 
air with his open hand, or push it along the ice with his hand, and the play shall not be stopped unless, in the opinion of the on- ice officials, 
he has directed the puck to a teammate, or has allowed his team to gain an advantage, and subsequently possession and control of the puck is obtained by a player of the offending team, either directly or 
deflected off any player or official. 
For violations related to “closing his hand on the puck”, refer to 
Rule 67 – Handling Puck. 
79.2 Defending Zone  - Play will not be stopped for any hand pass by 
players in their own defending zone. The location of the puck when 
contacted by either the player making the hand pass or the player 
receiving the hand pass shall determine the zone it is in. 
79.3 Face-Off Location  – When a hand pass violation has occurred, the 
ensuing face-off shall take place at the nearest face-off spot in the 
zone where the offense occurred, unless the offending team gains a 
territorial advantage, then the face-off shall be at t he nearest face -off 
spot in the zone where the stoppage of play occurred, unless 
otherwise covered in the rules. When a hand pass violation occurs by 
a team in their attacking zone, the ensuing face-off shall be conducted at one of the face- off spots outsi de the defending team’s blue line in 
the neutral zone. 
Rule 80 – High-sticking the Puck 
80.1 High-sticking the Puck  – For infractions involving high-sticks, refer to 
Rule 60 – High-sticking. 
Batting the puck above the normal height of the shoulders with 
a stick is prohibited. When a puck is struck with a high stick and subsequently comes into the possession and control of a player from 
the offending team (including the player who made contact with the 
puck), either directly or deflected off any player or official,  there shall 
be a whistle. 
When a puck has been contacted by a high stick, the play shall 
be permitted to continue, provided that:  
(i) the puck has been batted to an opponent (when a play er bats the 
puck to an opponent, the Referee shall give the “washout” signal 
immediately. Otherwise, he will stop the play). SECTION 10 – GAME FLOW 
NATIONAL HOCKEY LEAGUE  OFFICIAL RULES 20 21-2022 
122 (ii) a player of the defending side shall bat the puck into his own goal in 
which case the goal shall be allowed. 
Cradling the puck on the blade of the stick (like lacrosse) above 
the normal height of the shoulders shall be prohibited and a stoppage 
of play shall result.  If this is done by a player on a penalty shot or 
shootout attempt, the shot shall be stopped immediately and 
considered complete. 
80.2 Face-Off Location  - When the play is stopped for the high-sticking 
the puck violation, the ensuing face-off must take place at the spot 
that provides the least amount of territorial advantage to the team 
striking the puck, either where the puck was contacted illegally, or 
where it was last played by the offending team.  If the attacking team 
is at fault and the play is stopped while the puck is in the attacking 
zone, the ensuing face-off must be moved to the nearest face- off spot 
in the neut ral zone. 
80.3 Disallowed Goal – When an attacking player causes the puck to 
enter the opponent’s goal by contacting the puck above the height of the crossbar, either directly or deflected off any player or official, the 
goal shall not be allowed. The determining factor is where the puck 
makes contact with the stick. If the puck makes contact with the stick at or below the level of the crossbar and enters the goal, this goal 
shall be allowed. 
A goal scored as a result of a defending player striking the puck 
with his stick carried above the height of the crossbar of the goal frame into his own goal shall be allowed. 
Rule 81 – Icing  
81.1 Icing  – For the purpose of this rule, the center red line will divide the 
ice into halves. Should any player of a team, equal or superior in 
numerical strength (power -play) to the opposing team, shoot, bat or 
deflect the puck from his own half of the ice beyond the goal line of 
the opposing team, play shall be stopped.  For the purpose of 
deflected pucks, this only applies when the puck was originally 
propelled down the ice by the offending team.   
For the purpose of this rule, the point of last contact with the puck 
by the team in possession shall be used to determine whether icing 
has occurred or not. As such, the team in possession must “gain the line” in order for the icing to be nullified. “Gaining the line” shall mean 
that the puck, while on the player’s stick (not the player’s skate) must 
make contact with the center red line in order to nullify a potential 
icing. 
For the purpose of interpretation of the rule, there are two 
judgments required for "icing the puck". The Linesman must first 
determine that the puck will cross the goal line. Once the Linesman 
determines that the puck will cross the goal line, icing is completed 
upon the determination as to which player (attacking or defending) would first touch the puck. This decision by the Linesman will be made 
by no later than the instant the first player reaches the end zone face-
off dots with the player's skate being the determining factor. Should SECTION 10 –GAME FLOW
NATIONAL HOCKEY LEAGUE OFFICIAL RULES 20 21-2022
123the puck be shot down the ice in such a manner that it travels around
the boards and/or back towards the end zone face-off dots, the same 
procedure shall be in effect in that the Linesman shall determine
within a similar distance as to who will have touched the puck first.
For clarification, the determining factor is which player would first 
touch the puck, not which player would first reach the end zone face -
off dots.
If the race for the puck is too close to determine by the time the
first player reach esthe end zone face -off dots, icing shall be called.
The puck striking or deflecting off an official does not automatically 
nullify a potential icing. 
81.2 Face -Off Location –Following an icing, the attacking team will have 
the choice of which end zone dot the face -off will take place.
If, in the opinion of the Referee, the defending side intentionally 
abstains from playing the puck promptly when they are in a position to 
do so, he shall stop the play and order the resulting face -off on the 
adjacent corner face -off spot nearest the goal of the team at fault.
If the Linesman shall have erred in calling an “icing the puck” 
infraction (regardless of whether either team is short -handed), the
puck shall be faced -off on the center ice face -off spot.
81.3 Goalkeeper -If, in the opinion of the Linesman, the goalkeeper feigns
playing the puck, attempts to play the puck, or skates in the direction 
of the puck on an icing at any time, the potential icing shall not be 
called and play shall continue.
If, however, a goalkeeper is legitimately out of the crease in an 
attempt to go t o the players’ bench to be substituted for an extra 
attacker and in no way makes an attempt to play the puck, the icing
should not be nullified under this section.
If the goalkeeper is out of his crease prior to the shot being taken, 
and simply retreats to his crease making no attempt to play the puck 
or feign playing the puck, the potential icing shall remain in effect.
81.4 Line Change on Icing -A team that is in violation of this rule shall not 
be permitted to make any player substitutions prior to the ensu ing 
face-off. However, a team shall be permitted to make a player 
substitution to replace a goalkeeper who had been substituted for an
extra attacker, to replace an injured player, or when a penalty has 
been assessed which affects the on -ice strength of ei ther team. The
determination of players on ice will be made when the puck leaves the 
offending player’s stick.
81.5 No Icing –When the puck is shot and rebounds from the body or stick 
of an opponent in his own half of the ice so as to cross the goal line of 
the player shooting, it shall not be considered “icing.”
When a puck is shot by a team from their own half of the ice and is 
deflected several times before crossing the center red line, icing shall 
be nullified if at least one of these deflections was off an opposing 
player.
If the puck shall go beyond the goal line in the opposite half of the 
ice directly from either of the players while facing -off, it shall not beSECTION 10 –GAME FLOW
NATIONAL HOCKEY LEAGUE OFFICIAL RULES 20 21-2022
122(ii) a player of the defending side shall bat the puck into his own goal in 
which case the goal shall be allowed.
Cradling the puck on t he blade of the stick (like lacrosse) above
the normal height of the shoulders shall be prohibited and a stoppage
of play shall result.  If this is done by a player on a penalty shot or
shootout attempt, the shot shall be stopped immediately and 
considered complete.
80.2 Face -Off Location -When the play is stopped for the high -sticking 
the puck violation, the ensuing face -off must take place at the spot 
that provides the least amount of territorial advantage to the team 
striking the puck, either where the puck was contacted illegally, or
where it was last played by the offending team.  If the attacking team
is at fault and the play is stopped while the puck is in the attacking 
zone, the ensuing face -off must be moved to the nearest face -off spot 
in the neut ral zone.
80.3 Disallowed Goal –When an attacking player causes the puck to 
enter the opponent’s goal by contacting the puck above the height of 
the crossbar, either directly or deflected off any player or official, the 
goal shall not be allowed. The determini ng factor is where the puck 
makes contact with the stick. If the puck makes contact with the stick 
at or below the level of the crossbar and enters the goal, this goal
shall be allowed.
A goal scored as a result of a defending player striking the puck 
withhis stick carried above the height of the crossbar of the goal 
frame into his own goal shall be allowed.
Rule 81–Icing
81.1 Icing –For the purpose of this rule, the center red line will divide the 
ice into halves. Should any player of a team, equal or superior in
numerical strength (power -play) to the opposing team, shoot, bat or
deflect the puck from his own half of the ice beyond the goal line of 
the opposing team, play shall be stopped.  For the purpose of 
deflected pucks, this only applies when the puck was originally 
propelled down the ice by the offending team.  
For the purpose of this rule, the point of last contact with the puck 
by the team in possession shall be used to determine whether icing
has occurred or not. As such, the team in possession must “gain the

NATIONAL HOCKEY LEAGUE  OFFICIAL RULES 20 21-2022 
123 the puck be shot down the ice in such a manner that it travels around 
the boards and/or back towards the end zone face- off dots, the same 
procedure shall be in effect in that the Linesman shall determine 
within a similar distance as to who will have touched the puck first. 
For clarification, the determining factor is which player would first 
touch the puck, not which player would first reach the end zone face-
off dots.  
If the race for the puck is too close to determine by the time the 
first player reach es the end zone face-off dots, icing shall be called. 
The puck striking or deflecting off an official does not automatically 
nullify a potential icing.  
81.2 Face-Off Location  – Following an icing, the attacking team will have 
the choice of which end zone dot the face-off will take place. 
If, in the opinion of the Referee, the defending side intentionally 
abstains from playing the puck promptly when they are in a position to do so, he shall stop the play and order the resulting face- off on the 
adjacent corner face-off spot nearest the goal of the team at fault. 
If the Linesman shall have erred in calling an “icing the puck” 
infraction (regardless of whether either team is short-handed), the puck shall be faced-off on the center ice face- off spot.  
81.3 Goalkeeper  - If, in the opinion of the Linesman, the goalkeeper feigns 
playing the puck, attempts to play the puck, or skates in the direction 
of the puck on an icing at any time, the potential icing shall not be 
called and play shall continue. 
If, however, a goalkeeper is legitimately out of the crease in an 
attempt to go to the players’ bench to be substituted for an extra 
attacker and in no way makes an attempt to play the puck, the icing 
should not be nullified under this section. 
If the goalkeeper is out of his crease prior to the shot being taken, 
and simply retreats to his crease making no attempt to play the puck 
or feign playing the puck, the potential icing shall remain in effect.  
81.4 Line Change on Icing  - A team that is in violation of this rule shall not 
be permitted to make any player substitutions prior to the ensuing 
face-off. However, a team shall be permitted to make a player substitution to replace a goalkeeper who had been substituted for an 
extra attacker, to replace an injured player, or when a penalty has 
been assessed which affects the on-ice strength of either team. The 
determination of players on ice will be made when the puck leaves the 
offending player’s stick.  
81.5 No Icing  – When the puck is shot and rebounds from the body or stick 
of an opponent in his own half of the ice so as to cross the goal line of the player shooting, it shall not be considered “icing.” 
When a puck is shot by a team from their own half of the ice and is 
deflected several times before crossing the center red line, icing shall 
be nullified if at least one of these deflections was off an opposing player. 
If the puck shall go beyond the goal line in the opposite half of the 
ice directly from either of the players while facing-off, it shall not be SECTION 10 – GAME FLOW 
NATIONAL HOCKEY LEAGUE  OFFICIAL RULES 20 21-2022 
124 considered a violation of this rule. 
If, in the opinion of the Linesman, any player (other than the 
goalkeeper) of the opposing team is able to play the puck before it 
passes his goal line, but has not done so, play shall continue and the 
icing violation shall not be called. This includes the situation whereby the opposing team, while in the process of making player substitutions 
during the play, are able to play the puck, but choose not to do so to 
avoid being called for too many men on the ice. Icing should not be 
called.  
If the puck touches any part of a player of the opposing side, 
including his skates or his stick, or if it touches any part of the 
opposing team’s goalkeeper, including his skates or his stick, at any 
time before or after crossing the goal line, it shall not be considered 
icing. 
If a goalkeeper takes any action to dislodge the puck from the 
back of the net, icing shall not be called. 
81.6 Numerical Strength  – If the puck was so shot by a player of a side 
below the numerical strength of the opposing team, play shall 
continue and the icing violation shall not be called. 
When a team is “short-handed” as the result of a penalty and the 
penalty is about to expire, the decision as to whether there has been 
an “icing” shall be determined at the instant the penalty expires.  
Should the puck be released from the stick of the player shooting the 
puck down the ice prior to the penalty expiring, the icing infraction 
shall not apply.  The action of the penalized player remaining in the penalty box will not alter the ruling. 
When a team is “short-handed” by reason of a major penalty, and 
they have neg lected to ensure there is a player on the penalty bench 
to exit upon the expiry of the penalty, they will continue to play short-handed but are not permitted to ice the puck. Icing will be called. They 
may substitute for this penalized player at the next s toppage of play. 
See Rule  20.3  – Major Penalties. 
Rule 82 – Line Changes 
82.1 Line Change  - Following the stoppage of play, the visiting team shall 
promptly place a line -up on the ice ready for play and no substitution 
shall be made from that time until play has been resumed. The home team may then make any desired substitution, except in case s 
following an icing, which does not result in the delay of the game. 
“Placing a line-up on the ice” shall mean that both teams shall 
place the full complement of players (and not exceed) to which they 
are entitled within the line change time frame. 
If the re is any undue delay by either team in changing players, the 
Referee shall order the offending team or teams to take their positions immediately and not permit any further player changes. 
When a substitution has been made under the above rule, no 
additional substitution may be made until play commences. SECTION 10 –GAME FLOW
NATIONAL HOCKEY LEAGUE OFFICIAL RULES 20 21-2022
125Once the line change procedure has been completed ( 82.2), no 
additional player substitutions shall be permitted until the face -off has 
been completed legally and play has resumed, except when a penalty 
or penalties are imposed that affect the on -ice strength of either or
both teams. This may include penalties imposed following the
completion of the line change and prior to the face -off, or due to a 
penalty assessed for a face -off violation. 
A team that is i n violation of Rule 63.8 –Delaying the Game or
Rule 81–Icing shall not be permitted to make any player substitutions
prior to the ensuing face -off. However, a team shall be permitted to 
make a player substitution to replace a goalkeeper who had been
substituted for an extra attacker, to replace an injured p layer, or when 
a penalty has been assessed which affects the on -ice strength of 
either team. The determination of players on ice will be made when 
the puck leaves the offending player’s stick.
Goalkeepers’ substitution during a game will be conducted withi n 
the same time frame as a regular line change. No extra time will be 
allotted to the goalkeeper coming off the bench, except in the case
where an injury to a goalkeeper occurs.
82.2Procedure -Following a stoppage of play, the Referee will enforce 
the following line change procedure once he has determined that this 
procedure may begin:
(i) The Referee shall give the visiting team up to five (5) seconds to

the home team.
(v) Any attempt by the either team to make a change after the Referee’s 
signal, attempt to place too many men on the ice for the subsequent
line change, or attempt to make additional personnel changes, shall
not be permitted and the Referee will send the players who have
attempted to change back to their players’ bench. The Referee will
then issue a warning to the offending team (through the Coach) 
indicating that any subsequent violations during the rest of the game 
(including overtime), shall result in a bench minor penalty for delaying 
the game. T his penalty shall be announced as a “Bench Minor
Penalty for Delay of Game –Improper Line Change.”
(vi) The Linesman conducting the face -off will blow his whistle (once the 
Referee has lowered his hand for the line changes) to indicate that all
players must be in position and on -side for the face -off within five (5) 
seconds. The face -off will then be conducted in accordance with Rule
76 –Face -offs.
(vii) Players who are slow (after the five -second warning whistle given by 
the Linesman) getting to the face -off locati on or who are in an off -side 
position for the ensuing face -off will be warned once in the game by 
the Referee. This warning will also be given to the offending team’s 
Coach. In this situation, the offending team’s center is not ejected 
from the face -off.  Any subsequent violation shall result in a bench 
minor penalty for delay of game being assessed to the offending SECTION 10 –GAME FLOW

124considered a violation of this rule.
If, in the opinion of the Linesman, any player (other tha n the
goalkeeper) of the opposing team is able to play the puck before it 
passes his goal line, but has not done so, play shall continue and the
icing violation shall not be called. This includes the situation whereby
the opposing team, while in the proces s of making player substitutions
during the play, are able to play the puck, but choose not to do so to 
avoid being called for too many men on the ice. Icing should not be
called. 
If the puck touches any part of a player of the opposing side, 
including hi s skates or his stick, or if it touches any part of the
opposing team’s goalkeeper, including his skates or his stick, at any 
time before or after crossing the goal line, it shall not be considered 
icing.
If a goalkeeper takes any action to dislodge the pu ck from the
back of the net, icing shall not be called.
81.6 Numerical Strength –If the puck was so shot by a player of a side
below the numerical strength of the opposing team, play shall 
continue and the icing violation shall not be called.
When a team is “s hort-handed” as the result of a penalty and the 
penalty is about to expire, the decision as to whether there has been
an “icing” shall be determined at the instant the penalty expires.  
Should the puck be released from the stick of the player shooting the
puck down the ice prior to the penalty expiring, the icing infraction 
shall not apply.  The action of the penalized player remaining in the
penalty box will not alter the ruling.
When a team is “short -handed” by reason of a major penalty, and
they have neg lected to ensure there is a player on the penalty bench 
to exit upon the expiry of the penalty, they will continue to play short -
handed but are not permitted to ice the puck. Icing will be called. They 
may substitute for this penalized player at the next s toppage of play. 
See Rule 20.3 –Major Penalties.
Rule 82–Line Changes
82.1Line Change -Following the stoppage of play, the visiting team shall
promptly place a line -up on the ice ready for play and no substitution 
shall be made from that time until play has been resumed. The home 
team may then make any desired substitution, except in case s 
following an icing, which does not result in the delay of the game.
“Placing a line -up on the ice” shall mean that both teams shall
place the full complement of players (and not exceed) to which they 
are entitled within the line change time frame.
If the re is any undue delay by either team in changing players, the
Referee shall order the offending team or teams to take their positions 
immediately and not permit any further player changes.
When a substitution has been made under the above rule, no
addition al substitution may be made until play commences.SECTION 10 – GAME FLOW 
NATIONAL HOCKEY LEAGUE  OFFICIAL RULES 20 21-2022 
125 Once the line change procedure has been completed ( 82.2), no 
additional player substitutions shall be permitted until the face- off has 
been completed legally and play has resumed, except when a penalty 
or penalties are imposed that affect the on-ice strength of either or 
both teams. This may include penalties imposed following the completion of the line change and prior to the face-off, or due to a 
penalty assessed for a face- off violation.  
A team that is in violation of Rule 63.8 – Delaying the Game or 
Rule 81 – Icing shall not be permitted to make any player substitutions 
prior to the ensuing face-off. However, a team shall be permitted to 
make a player substitution to replace a goalkeeper who had been substituted for an extra attacker, to replace an injured p layer, or when 
a penalty has been assessed which affects the on-ice strength of either team. The determination of players on ice will be made when 
the puck leaves the offending player’s stick. 
Goalkeepers’ substitution during a game will be conducted withi n 
the same time frame as a regular line change. No extra time will be 
allotted to the goalkeeper coming off the bench, except in the case 
where an injury to a goalkeeper occurs. 
82.2 Procedure - Following a stoppage of play, the Referee will enforce 
the following line change procedure once he has determined that this procedure may begin:  
(i) The Referee shall give the visiting team up to five (5) seconds to 
make its line change. 
(ii) The Referee shall raise his hand to indicate no further changes by the 
visiting team and to commence the home team’s line change. 
(iii) The Referee shall give the home team up to eight (8) seconds to 
make its line change. 
(iv) The Referee shall lower his hand to indicate no further changes by the 
home team. 
(v) Any attempt by the either team to make a change after the Referee’s 
signal, attempt to place too many men on the ice for the subsequent 
line change, or attempt to make additional personnel changes, shall 
not be permitted and the Referee will send the players who have 
attempted to change back to their players’ bench. The Referee will 
then issue a warning to the offending team (through the Coach) 
indicating that any subsequent violations during the rest of the game (including overtime), shall result in a bench minor penalty for delaying the game. This penalty shall be announced as a “Bench Minor Penalty 
for Delay of Game – Improper Line Change.”  
(vi) The Linesman conducting the face-off will blow his whistle (once the 
Referee has lowered his hand for the line changes) to indicate that all 
players must be in position and on-side for the face-off within five (5) 
seconds. The face-off will then be conducted in accordance with  Rule 
76 – Face-offs.
(vii) Players who are slow (after the five-second warning whistle given by 
the Linesman) getting to the face-off location or who are in an off-side position for the ensuing face-off will be warned once in the game by the Referee. This warning will also be given to the offending team’s Coach. In this situation, the offending team’s center is not ejected from the face-off.  Any subsequent violation shall result in a bench 
minor penalty for delay of game being assessed to the offending team.SECTION 10 – GAME FLOW 
NATIONAL HOCKEY LEAGUE  OFFICIAL RULES 20 21-2022 
126 (viii) In the last two (2) minutes of regulation time and any time in  the 
overtime period(s), points (vi) and (vii) above are not applicable. The 
Linesman shall give the teams a reasonable amount of time to set up 
for the ensuing face- off after points (1) through (5) above have been 
enforced. 
82.3 Bench Minor Penalty  - Any attempt by the visiting team to make a 
change after the Referee’s signal shall result in the assessment of a 
bench minor penalty for delay of game. 
Players must proceed directly to the location of the face- off to 
participate in the ensuing face-off. Any attempts to delay the game by 
stalling or otherwise unnecessary actions by either team shall result in 
the assessment of a bench minor penalty for delaying the game. This 
penalty shall be announced as a “Bench Minor Penalty for Delay of 
Game – Slow Proceeding to Face-off Location (or, Slow Proceeding to Players’ Bench).” 
During the play, if a player wishes to retire from the ice and be 
replaced by a substitute, he must do so at the players’ bench and not 
through any other exit leading from the rink.  This is not a legal player change and therefore when a violation occurs, a bench minor penalty 
shall be imposed. 
Rule 83 – Off-side 
83.1 Off-side  - Players of the attacking team must not precede the puck 
into the attacking zone. 
The position of the player’s skates and not that of his stick shall be 
the determining factor in all instances in deciding an off-side. A player 
is off-side when both skates are completely over the leading  edge of 
the blue line involved in the play. 
A player is on-side when either of his skates are in contact with the 
blue line, or on his own side of the line, at the instant the puck 
completely crosses the leading  edge of the blue  line.  On his own side 
of the line shall be defined by a “plane” of the blue line which shall 
extend from the leading edge of the blue line upwards.  If a player’s 
skate has yet to break the “plane” prior to the puck completely 
crossing the leading edge, he is deemed to be on-side for the purpos e 
of the off-side rule.   
A player actually controlling the puck who shall cross the line 
ahead of the puck shall not be considered “off-side,” provided he had possession and control of the puck prior to his skates crossing the 
leading edge of the blue line. 
If a player legally carries , passes or plays the puck back into his 
own defending zone while a player of the opposing team is in such 
defending zone, the off-side shall be ignored and play permitted to 
continue. 
83.2 Deflections / Rebounds – For the purposes of this section, it is 
stipulated that an attacking player has preceded the puck into the attacking zone. SECTION 10 –GAME FLOW
NATIONAL HOCKEY LEAGUE OFFICIAL RULES 20 21-2022
127When a defending player propels the puck out of his defending 
zone and the puck clearly rebounds off a defending player in the
neutral zone back into the defending zone, all attacking pla yers are 
eligible to play the puck.  However, any action by an attacking player
that causes a deflection/rebound off a defending player in the neutral
zone back into the defending zone (i.e. stick check, body check, 
physical contact), a delayed off -side sh all be signaled by the 
Linesman.
A puck that deflects back into the defending zone off an official
who is in the neutral zone will be off -side (or delayed off -side, as 
appropriate).
A puck which deflects off an attacking player outside the blue line 
into the attacking zone, regardless of who originally propelled it or 
where it was propelled from, shall be r uled off -side or delayed off -side, 
as appropriate.
A puck which is propelled by the attacking team and deflects off
any player shall be ruled off -side or delayed off -side, as appropriate.
83.3 Delayed Off -side–A situation where an attacking player (or players) 
has preceded the puck across the attacking blue line, but the
defending team is in a position to bring the puck back out of its 
defending zone wi thout any delay or contact with an attacking player, 
or, the attacking players are in the process of clearing the attacking 
zone.
If an off -side call is delayed, the Linesman shall drop his arm to 
nullify the off -side violation and allow play to continue if:
(i) All players of the offending team clear the zone at the same instant 
(skate contact with the blue line) permitting the attacking players to 
re-enter the attacking zone, or
(ii) The defending team passes or carries the puck into the neutral zone.
If, during the course of the delayed off -side, any member of the
attacking team touches the puck, attempts to gain possession of a 
loose puck, forces the defending puck carrier further back into his own 
zone, or who is about to make physical contact with the defending 
puck carrier, the Linesman shall stop play for the off -side violation.
If, during a delayed off -side, an attacking player in the attacking 
zone elects to proceed to his players’ bench (which extends into the 
attacking zone) to be replaced by a t eammate, he shall be considered 
to have cleared the zone when both skates are off the ice and the
Linesman judg es him to have left the playing surface .If his 
replacement comes onto the ice in the attacking zone, while the
delayed off -side is still in effect, he too must clear the attacking zone. 
Once all attacking players have cleared the attacking zone and the 
Linesman has lowered his arm for the delayed off -side, all attacking
players may legally enter the attacking zone and pursue the puck . 
83.4Disallowed Goal –If the puck is shot into the attacking zone creating
a delayed off -side, the play shall be allowed to continue under the 
normal clearing -the-zone rules. Should the puck, as a result of this 
shot, enter the defending team’s goal, either directly or off t he 
goalkeeper, a player , the boards, the glass, a piece of equipment orSECTION 10 –GAME FLOW
NATIONAL HOCKEY LEAGUE OFFICIAL RULES 20 21-2022
126team. 
(viii) In the last two (2) minutes of regulation time and any time in the
overtime period(s), points (vi) and (vii) above are not applicable . The 
Linesman shall give the teams a reasonable amount of time to set up 
for the ensuing face -off after points (1) through (5) above have been 
enforced.
82.3 Bench Minor Penalty -Any attempt by the visiting team to make a
change after the Referee’s signal sha ll result in the assessment of a 
bench minor penalty for delay of game.
Players must proceed directly to the location of the face -off to 
participate in the ensuing face -off. Any attempts to delay the game by 
stalling or otherwise unnecessary actions by eit her team shall result in
the assessment of a bench minor penalty for delaying the game. This 
penalty shall be announced as a “Bench Minor Penalty for Delay of 
Game –Slow Proceeding to Face -off Location (or, Slow Proceeding to 
Players’ Bench).”
During the play, if a player wishes to retire from the ice and be
replaced by a substitute, he must do so at the players’ bench and not 
through any other exit leading from the rink.  This is not a legal player 
change and therefore when a violation occurs, a bench minor penalty 
shall be imposed.
Rule 83–Off-side
83.1Off-side -Players of the attacking team must not precede the puck 
into the attacking zone.
The position of the player’s skates and not that of his stick shall be 
the determining factor in all instances in deciding an off -side. A player 
is off -side when both skates are completely over the leading edge of 
the blue line involved in the play.
A player is on -side when either of his skates are in contact with the
blue line , or on his own side of the line, at the instant the puck 
completely crosses the leading edge of the blue line.  On his own side 
of the lin e shall be defined by a “plane” of the blue line which shall
extend from the leading edge of the blue l ine upwards.  If a player’s
skate has yet to break the “plane” prior to the puck completely 
crossing the leading edge, he is deemed to be on -side for the purpos e 
of the off -side rule.  
Aplayer actually controlling the puck who shall cross the line 
ahead of the puck shall not be considered “off -side,” provided he had
possession and control of the puck prior to his skates crossing the
leading edge of the blue line.
If a player legally carries , passes or plays the puck back into his 
own defending zone while a player of the opposing team is in such 
defending zone, the off -side shall be ignored and play permitted to 
continue.
83.2 Deflections / Rebounds –For the purposes of this section, it is 
stipulated tha t an attacking player has preceded the puck into the
attacking zone.SECTION 10 – GAME FLOW 
NATIONAL HOCKEY LEAGUE  OFFICIAL RULES 20 21-2022 
127 When a defending player propels the puck out of his defending 
zone and the puck clearly rebounds off a defending player in the 
neutral zone back into the defending zone, all attacking players are 
eligible to play the puck.  However, any action by an attacking player 
that causes a deflection/rebound off a defending player in the neutral zone back into the defending zone (i.e. stick check, body check, 
physical contact), a delayed off -side sh all be signaled by the 
Linesman. 
A puck that deflects back into the defending zone off an official 
who is in the neutral zone will be off-side (or delayed off-side, as 
appropriate). 
A puck which deflects off an attacking player outside the blue line 
into the attacking zone, regardless of who originally propelled it or 
where it was propelled from, shall be ruled off-side or delayed off-side, 
as appropriate. 
A puck which is propelled by the attacking team and deflects off 
any player shall be ruled off-side or delayed off- side, as appropriate.  
83.3 Delayed Off-side – A situation where an attacking player (or players) 
has preceded the puck across the attacking blue line, but the defending team is in a position to bring the puck back out of its defending zone without any delay or contact with an attacking player, 
or, the attacking players are in the process of clearing the attacking 
zone. 
If an off-side call is delayed, the Linesman shall drop his arm to 
nullify the off-side violation and allow play to continue if: 
(i) All players of the offending team clear the zone at the same instant 
(skate contact with the blue line) permitting the attacking players to 
re-enter the attacking zone, or 
(ii) The defending team passes or carries the puck into the neutral zone.
If, during the course of the delayed off-side, any member of the 
attacking team touches the puck, attempts to gain possession of a 
loose puck, forces the defending puck carrier further back into his own 
zone, or who is about to make physical contact with the defending 
puck carrier, the Linesman shall stop play for the off-side violation. 
If, during a delayed off-side, an attacking player in the attacking 
zone elects to proceed to his players’ bench (which extends into the 
attacking zone) to be replaced by a teammate, he shall be considered 
to have cleared the zone when both skates are off the ice and the 
Linesman judg es him to have left the playing surface. If his 
replacement comes onto the ice in the attacking zone, while the 
delayed off-side is still in effect, he too must clear the attacking zone. 
Once all attacking players have  cleared the attacking zone and the 
Linesman has lowered his arm for the delayed off-side, all attacking 
players may legally enter the attacking zone and pursue the puck .  
83.4 Disallowed Goal  – If the puck is shot into the attacking zone creating 
a delayed off -side, the play shall be allowed to continue under the 
normal clearing- the-zone rules. Should the puck, as a result of this 
shot, enter the defending team’s goal, either directly or off t he 
goalkeeper, a player, the boards, the glass, a piece of equipment or SECTION 10 – GAME FLOW 
NATIONAL HOCKEY LEAGUE  OFFICIAL RULES 20 21-2022 
128 an official on the ice, the goal shall be disallowed as the original shot 
was off-side. The fact that the attacking team may have cleared the 
zone prior to the puck entering the goal has no bearing on this ruling.  
The face- off will be conducted at the face -off spot in the zone closest 
to the point of origin of the shot that gives the offending team the least amount of territorial advantage. 
The only way an attacking team can score a goal on a delayed off-
side situation is if the defending team shoots or puts the puck into their own net without action or contact by the offending team.   
Other than in situations involving a delayed off-side and the puck 
entering the goal or a successful Coach’s Challenge (see Rule 38), no 
goal can be disallowed after the fact for an off- side violation, except 
for the human factor involved in blowing the whistle.  
83.5 Coach’s Challenge  – Refer to Rule 38. 
83.6 Face-Off Location  - For violation of this rule, the play is stopped and 
the puck shall be faced-off in the neutral zone at the face- off spot 
nearest the attacking zone of the offending team when the violation 
occurs as a result of the attacking team carrying the puck over the 
attacking blue line, or from the face-off spot in the zone closest to the 
point of origin of the shot or pass (even if deflected off an attacking or 
defending player or an official). 
For every delayed off-side situation, including an intentional off-
side, the Linesman will raise his non-whistle arm. He will allow play to 
continue and, if a stoppage of play occurs, there will be four possible 
face- off locations:  
(i) If carried over the blue line –  face-off outside the blue line.
(ii)If shot into the zone (or errant pass) – nearest face -off spot in the zone
from which the pass or shot originated that gives the offending team 
the least amount of territorial advantage (even if deflected off an attacking or defending player or an official).
(iii) If the defending player is pressured or about to be checked by an 
attacking player – nearest face -off spot in the zone from which the pass 
or shot originated that gives the offending team the least amount of 
territorial advantage (even if deflected of f an attacking or defending 
player or an official). 
(iv)If deemed to be an intentional off-side – face-off spot in the offending 
team’s end zone. 
When the Linesman signals a delayed off-side and a defending 
player shoots the puck which goes over the glass and out of play, the 
ensuing face-off shall be conducted at one of the defending zone end 
zone face-off spots (and the defending player would be assessed a 
minor penalty under Rule 63 – Delaying the Game).  
When the Linesman signals a delayed off-side and the original shot 
deflects off a defending player and out of play, the ensuing face-off 
shall take place at the nearest face-off spot in the zone from where the 
puck was shot. 
When the defending team is about to be penalized in the defending 
zone and the Linesman has a delayed off-side signaled against the 
attacking team on the same play, the ensuing face-off shall be 
conducted at one of the defending zone end zone face-off spots.SECTION 10 –GAME FLOW
NATIONAL HOCKEY LEAGUE OFFICIAL RULES 20 21-2022
129spots. 
83.7 Intentional Off -side-An intentional off -side is one which is made for 
the purpose of securing a stoppage of play regardless of the reason, 
whether either team is short -handed. 
If in the opinion of the Linesman, an intentional off -side play has 
been made, the puck shall be faced -off at the end face -off spot in th e 
defending zone of the offending team.
If, while an off -side call is delayed, a player of the offending team 
deliberately touches the puck to create a stoppage of play, the
Linesman will signal an intentional off -side.
Rule 84–Overtime
84.1 Overtime –Regular -season -During regular -season games, if at the
end of the three (3) regular twenty (20) minute periods, the score shall
be tied, each team shall be awarded one point in the League 
standings.
The teams will then play an additional overti me period of not more 
than five (5) minutes with the team scoring first declared the winner 
and being awarded an additional point. The overtime period shall be
played with each team at a numerical strength of three (3) skaters and
one (1) goalkeeper. 
The overtime period will commence following a shoveling of the
entire ice surface by arena personnel utilizing the same procedures as 
are utilized during TV time -outs.
NOTE: No intermission time shall be put on the clock between the end of 
regulation and the start of overtime, bu tthe expectation is that the overtime 
period should commence approximately two (2) minutes after the end of 
regulation. Once the shoveling has been completed, the clock will be reset 
to 5:00 minutes and the overtime period will begin immediately.
The play ers will remain at their respective benches during the
period in which the shoveling of the entire ice surface takes place .
NOTE: Teams are not permitted to return to the dressing room during this 
time.
The teams must change ends for the overtime period. 
NOTE:  For the entire overtime period, teams will defend the same end -
zone as they do in the second period.
Goalkeepers must go to their respective players’ benches during 
this rest period, however, penalized players must remain on the
penalty bench. Shou ld a penalized player exit the penalty bench, he 
shall be returned immediately by the officials with no additional
penalty being assessed, unless he commits an infraction of any other
rule. 
84.2Overtime –Regular -season –Extra Attacker -A team shall be
allowed to pull its goalkeeper in favor of an additional skater in the
overtime period. However, should that team lose the game during the

128an official on the ice, the goal shall be disallowed as the original shot 
was off -side. The fact that the attacking team may have cleared the
zone prior to the puck entering the goal h as no bearing on this ruling. 
The face -off will be conducted at the face -off spot in the zone closest 
to the point of origin of the shot that gives the offending team the least 
amount of territorial advantage .
The only way an attacking team can score a go al on a delayed off -
side situation is if the defending team shoots or puts the puck into 
their own net without action or contact by the offending team.
Other than in situations involving a delayed off -side and the puck 
entering the goal or a successful Coach’s Challenge (see Rule 38),no
goal can be disallowed after the fact for an off -side violation, except 
for the human factor involved in blowing the whistle. 
83.5 Coach’s Challenge –Refer to Rule 38.
83.6Face -Off Location -For violation of this rule, the play is stopped and
the puck shall be faced -off in the neutral zone at the face -off spot 
nearest the attacking zone of the offending team when the violation 
occurs as a result of the attacking team carrying the pu ck over the 
attacking blue line, or from the face -off spot in the zone closest to the
point of origin of the shot or pass (even if deflected off an attacking or 
defending player or an official).
For every delayed off -side situation, including an intention al off -
side, the Linesman will raise his non -whistle arm. He will allow play to 
continue and, if a stoppage of play occurs, there will be four possible
face-off locations:
(i)If carried over the blue line –face-off outside the blue line.
(ii)If shot into the zone (or errant pass) –nearest face -off spot in the zone
from which the pass or shot originated that gives the offending team 
the least amount of territorial advantage (even if deflected off an
attacking or defending player or an official ).  
(iii)If the defending player is pressured or about to be checked by an 
attacking player –nearest face -off spot in the zone from which the pass 
or shot originated that gives the offending team the least amount of 
territorial advantage (even if deflected of f an attacking or defending 
player or an official).
(iv)If deemed to be an intentional off -side –face-off spot in the offending 
team’s end zone.
When the Linesman signals a delayed off -side and a defending 
player shoots the puck which goes over the glass an d out of play, the
ensuing face -off shall be conducted at one of the defending zone end 
zone face -off spots (and the defending player would be assessed a
minor penalty under Rule 63–Delaying the Game).
When the Linesman signals a delayed off-side and the original 
shot deflects off a defending player and out of play, the ensuing face -
off shall take place at the nearest face -off spot in the zone from where 
the puck was shot.
When the defending team is about to be penalized in the
defending zone and the Linesman has a delayed off -side signaled 
against the attacking team on the same play, the ensuing face -off 
shall be conducted at one of the defending zone end zone face -off SECTION 10 – GAME FLOW 
NATIONAL HOCKEY LEAGUE  OFFICIAL RULES 20 21-2022 
129    83.7 Intentional Off-s ide - An intentional off-side is one which is made for 
the purpose of securing a stoppage of play regardless of the reason, 
whether either team is short-handed.  
If in the opinion of the Linesman, an intentional off- side play has 
been made, the puck shall be faced-off at the end face-off spot in th e 
defending zone of the offending team. 
If, while an off-side call is delayed, a player of the offending team 
deliberately touches the puck to create a stoppage of play, the Linesman will signal an intentional off-side. 
Rule 84  – Overtime 
84.1 Overtime – Regular-season  - During regular-season games, if at the

NOTE:  No intermission time shall be put on the clock between the end of 
regulation and the start of overtime, bu t the expectation is that the overtime 
period should commence approximately two (2) minutes after the end of regulation.  Once the shoveling has been completed, the clock will be reset 
to 5:00 minutes and the overtime period will begin immediately. 
The players will remain at their respective benches during the 
period in which the shoveling of the entire ice surface takes place. 
NOTE:  Teams are not permitted to return to the dressing room during this time.

shall be returned immediately by the officials with no additional 
penalty being assessed, unless he commits an infraction of any other 
rule.  
84.2 Overtime – Regular-season – Extra Attacker  - A team shall be 
allowed to pull its goalkeeper in favor of an additional skater in the 
overtime period. However, should that team lose the game during the time in which the goalkeeper has been removed, it would forfeit the 
automatic point gained in the tie at the end of regulation play, except if 
the goalkeeper has been removed at the call of a delayed penalty 
against the other team. Should the goalkeeper proceed to his bench SECTION 10 – GAME FLOW

opposing team, and should the non-offending team shoot the puck 
directly into their own goal, the game shall be over and the team that 
was to be penalized declared the winner.  
Once the goalkeeper has been removed for an extra attacker in 
overtime during the regular-season, he must wait for the next 
stoppage of play before returning to his position. He cannot change “on the fly.”  If he does, a bench minor penalty shall be assessed for 
having an ineligible player. 
84.3 Overtime – Regular-season – Penalties  – When regulation ti me 
ends and the teams are 5 on 3, teams will start overtime 5 on 3. Once 
player strength reaches 5 on 4 or 5 on 5, at the next stoppage of play, 
player strength is adjusted to 4 on 3 or 3 on 3, as appropriate.  
When regulation ends and teams are 4 on 4 teams will start 
overtime 3 on 3.  
If at the end of regulation time teams are 3 on 3 , overtime starts 3

the Start of Overtime –  Regular Season  on page 1 60. 
If a team is penalized in overtime, teams play 4 on 3. If both teams 
are penalized with minor penalties at the same stoppage of play (with 
no other penalties in effect), teams will continue to play 3 on 3 . 
In overtime, if a team is penalized such that a two-man advantage 
is called for, then the offending team will remain at three (3) skaters 
while the non-offending team will be permitted five (5) skaters. 
At the first stoppage of play after the two-man advantage is no 
longer in effect, the numerical strength of the teams will revert back to 
4 on 3 or 3 on 3 , as appropriate.

refuses to give ground at the time a 
goal is scored.  Goal is disallowed. A m inor penalty is not
