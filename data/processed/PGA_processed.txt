Dear PGA TOUR Champions members,
Welcome to the 2024 PGA TOUR Champions season. The 2024 Tournament Regulations is a handy 
guide to specific rules pertaining to PGA TOUR Champions play. We have incorporated changes 
made to the Tournament Regulations since last year into this year's book. In addition, there is an 
index for quick reference.
These Regulations are the final authority on the operations and policies of PGA TOUR Champions. 
I encourage every member to become familiar with these rules.
The Player Handbook includes a 2024 tournament schedule and covers such topics as special-
event eligibility and year-end awards.
Best wishes for a successful 2024 season!
Jay Monahan

Rights) herein shall be deemed ineligible for membership. All references to PGA TOUR also shall 
refer and apply to PGA TOUR Champions and any special events that may from time to time be 
sanctioned by PGA TOUR Champions.
These Regulations may be amended or repealed from time to time, as provided in Article IX, Section 
I of these Regulations.
The Commissioner of the PGA TOUR shall interpret and apply these Regulations and, in the interim 
between meetings of PGA TOUR Champions Division Board, if he deems it in the interest of the 
game of golf, the sponsors, the public or the players, may waive or suspend the application of any

Regulations may apply to enter.
An "invitation" tournament is a cosponsored tournament whose participants are invited by the 
cosponsored tournament in accordance with categories set forth in the Tournament Agreement 
with PGA TOUR.
A "coordinated" tournament is a PGA TOUR-sanctioned PGA TOUR Champions tournament for 
which a Tournament Agreement exists, but for which (due to field size, format, time of year, or other 
such special circumstances) the purse is not considered official money and for which a conflicting 
event release is not required.
"Exempt" (i.e., an "exempt player") means automatically eligible to compete in particular tourna -
ments without any additional (i.e., event-by-event) qualifying, subject to the availability of space in 
the tournament field and to these Regulations.

official money (see Article IV, Section H.6) each has won in PGA TOUR Champions cosponsored or

 Winners of Major Championships on the PGA TOUR.

Exemptions.
 All Sponsor Exemptions (inclusive of Invitationals) must be provided to PGA TOUR 
Champions Administration by Commitment Deadline, (i.e., 5:00 pm ET of the Friday 
preceding the tournament). If a sponsor exemption becomes eligible for the tournament 
prior to 5:00 pm ET on Monday of tournament week due to withdrawals of other players, 
a top ten finish in the prior event, or any other means, the tournament may replace such 15
15player with another player from either category (e.g. restricted or unrestricted) not in 
the field up to 5:00 pm ET Monday of tournament week. Any Sponsor Exemption not 
provided by the aforementioned deadline shall be subject to replacement by available 
players in priority order from the alternate list. If there is any withdrawal by a sponsor 
exemption prior to Monday of tournament week at 5:00 p.m. ET, the sponsor may elect to 
choose another sponsor exemption from either category (e.g. restricted or unrestricted), 
provided that such exemption may not be granted to an exempt player who has failed 
to meet the applicable commitment deadline. After such time, the sponsor exemption 
shall be replaced by the next available alternate.
 NOTE: A tournament sponsor may not (i) hold a fundraising event for the purpose of 
determining a sponsor exemption or (ii) directly or indirectly award, offer or sell a sponsor 
exemption in exchange for any cash, in-kind or other consideration from a player, agency, 
sponsor, intermediary or any other person or entity. Without limitation, a tournament 
sponsor may not offer or sell a sponsorship, including any local sponsorship, pro-am or 
hospitality package, that is conditioned (in writing or implicitly) on the sponsor having the 
authority to directly or indirectly award a sponsor exemption. Further, without limitation, 
a tournament sponsor may not facilitate or enter into any arrangement whereby a player 
directly or indirectly provides cash, in-kind assets (e.g., an appearance), a share of the 
player's prize money, a committment from the player to engage the tournament sponsor 
for representation (where the tournament sponsor is also a player management group) 
or other consideration for a sponsor exemption. In the event of a potential violation, the 
PGA TOUR may request, and the tournament sponsor must provide, copies of contracts 
and other communications, financial reports, interviews and other information relating 
to the potential violation. A violation of the provisions of this paragraph will result in such 
sanctions determined by PGA TOUR, which will depend on the severity of the violation, 
whether the violation is a first or repeated offense and other factors. The sanctions may 
include a warning, loss of PGA TOUR accreditation for the Tournament Director, the loss 
of financial support from the PGA TOUR including loss if its annual cash contrabution 
contingent on compliance and/or the loss of one or more sponsor exemptions for the 
current or future years. Further, a violation of these provisions would be a breach of the 
tournament agreement and could result in the termination of the tournament agree -
ment. Further, a player who violates the provisions set forth in Article IV. Section B. (No 
Guarantee for Appearance) of these Regulations will be deemed to have engaged in 
conduct unbecoming a professional and may be subject to a fine, suspension from play 
in PGA TOUR cosponsored or approved tournaments, permanent disbarment from such 
play, and appropriate combination thereof or other discipline.

to fulfill the starting time or pro-am of the player he is replacing shall be disqualified from that 
tournament.
 Sponsor Exemption: If there is any withdrawal by a sponsor exemption prior to Monday of 
tournament week at 5:00 p.m. ET, the sponsor may elect to choose another sponsor exemption 
from either category (e.g. restricted or unrestricted), provided that such exemption may not be 
granted to an exempt player who has failed to meet the applicable commitment deadline. After 
such time, the sponsor exemption shall be replaced by the next available alternate.
 Event Qualifier: At any time prior to the start of the tournament, any withdrawal by an event 
qualifier will be replaced by a tournament alternate in priority order.
 Alternate Privileges: Prior to the commencement of the last starting time of the first official 
round of a tournament, the first six alternates and the two highest ranking alternates on-site 
beyond the first six alternates from the standard priority order shall have the following on-site 
tournament privileges: (1) full access to practice range and tournament course; (2) access to 
the contestant locker room, with locker privileges on a space available basis; (3) contestant 
parking; and (4) access to player/family dining.
E. PROFESSIONAL-AMATEUR EVENTS
 Unless provided otherwise in the Tournament Agreement or altered at the discretion of the Rules 
Official Tournament Director because of bad weather conditions or other similar circumstances, 
a PGA TOUR Champions tournament shall consist of two days of pro-am competition (normally 
Wednesday and Thursday) followed by three days (normally Friday, Saturday, and Sunday) of 
pro-only competition of 54 holes. All players participating in any pro-am round shall be required 
to return a signed scorecard for each round.
1. Pro-Am Obligation
 A commitment to enter a tournament is also a commitment to play in a minimum of one host 
course pro-am (i.e., Wednesday and or Thursday) as prescribed in this Article IV, Section 
E.2. Failure to meet this pro-am obligation (i.e., arrive at the starting point, ready to play 
within five minutes of assigned starting time) shall cause him to be ineligible for the tour-
nament, unless a player has registered on-site and is excused from the pro-am by PGA 
TOUR Champions President, his designee or the onsite Rules Official Tournament Director 
after presenting evidence of an injury or other disability which requires medical attention. 28
28Further, at the discretion of PGA TOUR Champions President, or his designee, a player may 
be excused from the pro-am due to serious personal emergency, such as a funeral or serious 
illness of a family member or close personal friend or other extenuating circumstances. 
In determining whether a player is excused due to extenuating circumstances, PGA TOUR 
Champions President, or his designee, will consider all factors, including the player's level 
of effort to satisfy his pro-am obligation. In the case of a player being excused due to a seri-
ous personal emergency or other extenuating circumstance, such member may be excused 
without having registered onsite. A player who is excused from the pro-am for any reason 
may be required to perform an additional pro-am obligation at some other time during the 
year in which the player was excused or perform a substitute tournament sponsor func -
tion. In addition, the player may be subject to disciplinary action for conduct unbecoming a 
professional golfer, which could include a fine or suspension from tournament play. Upon 
being excused from the pro-am, the player is not allowed to practice at the tournament 
site on the day of the pro-am, except on a limited basis as requested by medical or therapy 
personnel and approved by the onsite Rules Official Tournament Director. Further, the player 
must show best efforts to meet and/or contact his pro-am team explaining the reason for 
his absence.
2. Professional Field
 The professional field for each of the two pro-am rounds in the first cosponsored, open, 
full field event of the year and, thereafter, in each second subsequent such event (i.e. third 
event, fifth event, etc) shall be determined using Pro-Am Eligibility #1 and the professional 
field for each of the two pro-am rounds in the second cosponsored, open, full field event 
of the year and, thereafter in each second subsequent such event (i.e., fourth event, sixth 
event, eighth event, etc) shall be Pro-Am eligibility #2
 NOTE: Pro-Am field size shall consist of up to 56 players unless otherwise noted in the tourna -
ment agreement.

The Rules Officials will use a rotation system from week to week to give some relief to some 
of the players that play two pro-ams in back to back weeks.
Amateur players shall be selected or approved by the sponsor. Amateurs shall have up-to-date 
handicaps computed under the USGA handicap procedure. They shall use their full handicaps 
(maximum of 27) except that a plus handicap shall be changed to zero.
Women amateurs shall play from the ladies' or forward teeing grounds.
PGA TOUR must authorize in writing competitions with only one amateur on each team. Each 
professional player in any pro-am shall have executed the official entry form for the tournament. 
Notwithstanding any other provisions in these Regulations, a player who is not in the start -
ing field of a tournament is ineligible to compete in the pro-am at the tournament site unless 
expressly approved by the Commissioner or his designee. In any pro-am, the number of teams 
shall be limited to professional players and two, three or four amateur partners. Each group 
must have at least one professional.30
303. Postponement/Cancellation (Pro-Am)
 If, in the judgment of the Rules Official Tournament Director, adverse weather conditions or 
any other occurrence or condition beyond the control of PGA TOUR Champions or the tour-
nament render commencement or continuation of the pro-am inadvisable, the Rules Official 
Tournament Director may, in his discretion, postpone or cancel play therein. In the event of 
cancellation of the pro-am, after a professional has commenced play, Host Organization 
(i.e., tournament) will distribute the prize money to all professionals on a pro rata basis. If 
play on either day is not commenced, the Tournament will retain respective day's purse.
 Unless otherwise provided for in the Tournament Agreement, no pro-am shall be extended 
past Thursday.
 At the option of the tournament and subject to approval by PGA TOUR Champions, the 
pro-am may be conducted using the scramble format. Other general terms and conditions 
of such pro-am as described herein shall be applied, provided that each professional player 
in the pro-am will play at stroke play and will not be a part of the amateur scramble competi -
tion other than the use of his score on a hole.
4. Monday Outing Guidelines
 Tournaments must notify their respective Tournament Business Affairs representative in 
writing of their intent to stage a Monday outing to be played on the tournament course. 
Approval will be granted, by the President of PGA TOUR Champions or his designee, under 
the following conditions:
 Tournaments must use best efforts to stage pro-am using PGA TOUR Champions mem -
bers but are permitted to stage a Celebrity-Am or am-am
 Field size limited to a maximum of 26 groups
 Starting times are restricted to no later than a 9:00 a.m. shotgun start for a Celebrity-Am 
or am-am outing or between 11:00a.m. and 1:00p.m. for pro-am using PGA TOUR 
Champions members
 Securing the participation of the professional players is solely the responsibility of the 
tournament
 Professional players who participate in the Monday pro-am must be entered in that 
week's tournament. Should a tournament encounter difficulty completing the profes-
sional field, PGA TOUR Champions members not in a respective week's field may be 
invited to play in the pro-am subsequent to approval granted by PGA TOUR Champions 
Administration
 The purse for each Monday pro-am participant will be routed through the PGA TOUR 
for payment to the participating professionals. All professional players playing in the 
Monday Pro-Am must be paid. 
F. BEST EFFORTS; WITHDRAWALS
 A player withdrawing from the regular event, even if he has completed his pro-am obligation, 
forfeits any right to prize money.
 In making a commitment to participate in a PGA TOUR Champions cosponsored, coordinated 
or approved event, a player thereby obligates himself to attempt to exercise his maximum golf 
skill and to play in a professional manner.31
31 After making a commitment to participate in a tournament, a player shall not withdraw, either 
before or after signing an entry form for such event, except that:
1. After committing to play in a tournament, and before the tournament has commenced, a 
player may withdraw because of injury or other disability that requires medical attention, 
or serious personal emergency. The player shall immediately notify PGA TOUR Champions 
Rules and/or Administration of his reason for withdrawal.
 NOTE: Withdrawals from PGA TOUR Champions events may not be submitted via the electronic 
commitment system.
2. A player may withdraw after completing any round of 18 holes, upon notification to the 
Rules Official Tournament Director and returning a signed scorecard. Such player shall not, 
however, be paid any minimum guarantee amount, even if such withdrawal is caused by 
injury or illness.
3. During a round, a player may withdraw because of injury or other disability which requires 
medical attention, or serious personal emergency. Such player shall not, however, be paid 
any minimum guarantee amount. Without undue delay, the player shall notify the Rules 
Official Tournament Director of his reason for withdrawal.
4. If, after the commitment deadline, a player withdraws two times without registering onsite 
or fulfilling his pro-am obligation, that player is precluded from committing to more than 
one tournament at a time for the remainder of that season.
 A player who breaches this regulation shall be subject to a fine or suspension, or both, from 
play in PGA TOUR Champions cosponsored and coordinated events.
G. POSTPONEMENTS AND CANCELLATIONS (OFFICIAL ROUNDS)
 If, in the judgment of the Rules Official Tournament Director, adverse weather conditions or any 
other occurrence or condition beyond the control of PGA TOUR Champions renders commence -
ment or continuation of tournament play inadvisable, play shall be postponed until such time as 
the Rules Official Tournament Director, after consultation with the tournament, determines that 
such weather conditions or other occurrence have improved sufficiently for play to commence 
or resume, provided that:
 The completion of no such tournament shall be extended beyond Sunday of tournament week* 
(see note below), except that if at least half the field has completed play prior to the postpone-
ment or if a playoff is necessary to determine the tournament winner. The final round may be 
completed on Monday notwithstanding the above, if at least half the field has completed play 
prior to the postponement of a Sunday round. Play shall not be resumed unless, in the judg -
ment of the Rules Official Tournament Director, the entire field can reasonably be expected to 
complete the round on Sunday.
 In the event of cancellation of any part of a tournament, prize money shall be distributed among 
the lowest scorers after the last completed round of play in the same number, amounts and 
order as for the originally scheduled number of holes. If a tournament is shortened to not less 32
32than two rounds and there is a tie for first place, there will be a playoff at a convenient time 
as determined by the Rules Official Tournament Director. The tournament will be considered 
official (e.g., for purposes of determining official money, official win, etc.) if at least two rounds 
have been played.
 If less than one round of the tournament is played as the result of any cancellation, the tourna-
ment shall not be required to pay any prize money and shall refund any dues paid for limited 
PGA TOUR Champions memberships by nonmember entrants. The tournament shall refund all 
entry fees paid.
 If, however, at least one round is completed, the tournament shall pay the full amount of any 
service fee payable to PGA TOUR under the Tournament Agreement, and shall pay at least 50% 
of the prize money.
 It is further provided that if at least one round has been played and if the tournament, in consul -
tation with the Rules Official Tournament Director, agrees to the shortening of the tournament 
(e.g., in order to determine the winner on Sunday), then, notwithstanding the above, the tourna-
ment shall pay 100 percent of the originally contracted-for prize money.
 NOTE: As detailed in Bad Weather Guidelines (pg.81), Regions Tradition, Kaulig Companies 
Championship, Dominion Energy Charity Classic, TimberTech Championship and Charles 
Schwab Cup Championship are exceptions to these guidelines.
H. GENERAL PROVISIONS
 The following general provisions relating to the conduct of PGA TOUR Champions events also 
shall apply:
1. Entry Forms
 All entry forms (whether electronic or paper forms) for PGA TOUR Champions cosponsored 
and coordinated tournaments shall be prepared by PGA TOUR.
 All entries shall be subject to acceptance by host organization and PGA TOUR, and may be 
rejected or revoked by either without liability at any time before or after commencement of 
tournament play if the entrant fails to meet the eligibility requirements set forth in the entry 
form and these Regulations, violates any of the regulations or otherwise conducts himself 
in a manner unbecoming a professional golfer. If a player's tournament entry is revoked, he 
shall not be entitled to share in the prize monies thereof.
 All players in PGA TOUR Champions cosponsored and coordinated tournaments shall grant 
and assign to PGA TOUR through their entry forms, without limitation, their individual televi -
sion, radio, motion picture, photographic, electronic, Internet and similar rights (including 
all forms of television and other electronic media) with respect to their participation in 
such tournaments, provided that PGA TOUR's use thereof shall be limited to advertising, 
promoting or publicizing PGA TOUR (Regular TOUR) and PGA TOUR Champions golf events 
or broadcasts related thereto, and provided further that in no case shall such rights be 
used in any broadcast, motion picture or other program on an electronic medium that is for 
instructional purposes without the express written consent of the player(s) involved.33
33 Players also shall agree in such entry forms to: (i) refrain from any action that will interfere 
with PGA TOUR's ownership and exercise of the rights granted and assigned to it hereunder, 
including any use by other parties of such rights that is authorized by PGA TOUR; (ii) abide 
by these Regulations, including any amendments thereto as may be adopted from time to 
time; and (iii) abide by the Rules of Golf of the United States Golf Association, subject to any 
modifications thereof approved by PGA TOUR Champions.
 A professional who has incorporated may enter PGA TOUR Champions cosponsored or 
coordinated tournaments in the name of his corporation, and any money winnings will 
be paid directly to such corporation, provided that the beneficial interest in such corpora-
tion is owned entirely by the professional (and/or members of his immediate family). The 
professional shall give a personal guarantee of all obligations of the corporation on a form 
prescribed by PGA TOUR Champions, and the player shall remain personally subject to all 
requirements applicable to players who enter such tournaments in their own names.
2. Course Preparation
 Preparation of the course shall be subject to approval of the Rules Official Tournament 
Director. Locations of teeing areas and hole positions on putting greens shall be approved 
by the Rules Official Tournament Director. The Rules Official Tournament Director may direct 
growing, cutting and watering of grass as he may deem advisable to provide appropriate 
playing conditions. Unnatural substances such as artificially colored sand like material in 
bunkers are prohibited.
3. Playoffs
 In the event of a tie for first place at the conclusion of the tournament in a PGA TOUR 
Champions cosponsored or coordinated tournament at stroke play, a playoff shall be con-
ducted for the purpose of determining the tournament winner. Such playoff shall be on a 
hole-by-hole basis immediately following the conclusion of the final round, or on the fol -
lowing day if the Rules Official Tournament Director determines that darkness, weather or 
other conditions preclude conducting a playoff on the day of the final round.
 Tournaments not nationally or regionally televised shall begin playoffs as determined by the 
Rules Official Tournament Director. Nationally or regionally televised tournaments shall use 
a hole-by-hole playoff commencing at a televised hole previously determined by the Rules 
Official Tournament Director.
 The winner of any playoff shall be deemed to have placed first in the tournament and his 
prize money determined accordingly. The loser of any playoff involving two players shall be 
deemed to have placed second and shall be entitled to second place prize money. If a playoff 
involves more than two players, those other than the winner shall be deemed to have tied 
for second place regardless of their scores in the playoffs, and their prize monies shall be 
apportioned accordingly. The determination of all prize monies shall be under the direction 
of the Rules Official Tournament Director.
4. Distribution of Purses
 The purses of all PGA TOUR Champions cosponsored and coordinated tournaments shall 
be distributed to the low finishers therein as determined by PGA TOUR Champions Division 
Board.34
345. Other Prizes
 Prizes of any nature for other than total score shall be subject to approval by the 
Commissioner.
6. Official Money
 Official money shall be awarded to individual prize winners in cosponsored and approved 
tournaments and such other events as PGA TOUR Champions Division Board may desig -
nate, even if part of the tournament is canceled, provided, however, that official money 
shall not be awarded in any team competition, or a pro-am tournament (but official money 
will be awarded in a tournament for individuals even if held concurrently with a pro-am 
tournament).
 NOTE: For purposes of determining official money standings, money won by a non-member 
shall count the same as money won by a PGA TOUR Champions member.
 NOTE: Any professional who has qualified for an official money event without a cut, without 
an alternate list, or outside North America, such as the Mitsubishi Electric Championship at 
Hualalai, Trophy Hassan II, Dominion Energy Charity Classic, Simmons Bank Championship 
and the Charles Schwab Cup Championship, but is forced to withdraw due to an injury or 
other personal circumstances, or is disqualified, will receive last place, unofficial money, 
provided such player has registered onsite at the respective tournament.35
35V .  CONFLICTING EVENTS; MEDIA 
AND MARKETING RIGHTS
A. CONFLICTING EVENTS
1. Obligations of PGA TOUR
 On a date on which any cosponsored PGA TOUR Champions tournament is being played, 
PGA TOUR will not cosponsor or approve any other similar golf tournament without the 
advance written consent of the first scheduled PGA TOUR Champions tournament or event, 
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. "Similar golf event" means a tournament 
of the same type. For example, PGA TOUR shall not be prohibited under this section from 
holding a PGA TOUR tournament or Korn Ferry Tour tournament on the same dates as a 
PGA TOUR Champions tournament.
2. Obligations of PGA TOUR Champions Members
 To contribute to the success of a PGA TOUR Champions tournament and to permit PGA 
TOUR to fulfill its contractual obligations concerning representative fields, no PGA TOUR 
Champions member shall participate in any other golf event on a date when a PGA TOUR 
Champions cosponsored tournament for which such member is exempt is scheduled, 
except as follows:
(a)  An event for which a member obtains an advance written release for his participation 
from the Commissioner. (See "Guidelines for Conflicting Event Release" set forth below).
 NOTE: No conflicting event releases will be approved for tournaments held in North America
(b) PGA TOUR cosponsored, coordinated or approved events.
(c)  The PGA Professional Championship and PGA of America winter events for profession -
als, including senior winter events, and any PGA section event with which a player is 
affiliated or where he is employed, provided he is eligible for such section tournaments 
under the constitution of the PGA of America.
(d) Golf events on the "home circuit" of a foreign player who is a PGA TOUR Champions 
member.
 NOTE: "Home circuit" is defined as the recognized professional golf circuit which plays all or 
some portion of its schedule in the country of which the player is a citizen. Such foreign PGA 
TOUR Champions member shall be eligible for this "home circuit" exception to the provisions 
of these Regulations with regard to conflicting events provided he has played, or committed 
to play, in a minimum of 15 PGA TOUR Champions cosponsored or approved tournaments in 
the year, as described in Section D.2 of Article IX (Membership Reinstatement Provisions). 
For "home circuit" designations please see PGA TOUR Player Handbook and Tournament 
Regulations.36
36(e)  THE PLAYERS Championship, the Masters, the U.S. Open, The Open Championship, the 
PGA Championship, the Senior PGA Championship, the U.S. Senior Open and The Senior 
Open presented by Rolex.
(f) The Ryder Cup or The Presidents Cup.
(g)  Korn Ferry Tour tournaments, but only for those PGA TOUR Champions members who 
gain eligibility to Korn Ferry Tour tournaments as a result of being Life Members, Past 
Champion Members, Special Temporary Members, Team Championship Members, or 
Veteran Members of the PGA TOUR (Regular TOUR).
 In addition, in a week when a PGA TOUR, PGA TOUR Champions, or Korn Ferry Tour cospon -
sored tournament is scheduled, no PGA TOUR Champions member shall participate in any 
golf activity (including public exhibitions, clinics, and pro-ams) in the same geographic 
area as such PGA TOUR, PGA TOUR Champions or Korn Ferry Tour Tournament without 
the prior approval of the Commissioner. Nothing in the foregoing shall preclude PGA TOUR 
Champions members from playing in outings during the week of a cosponsored tournament. 
As used herein, an "outing" refers to an event in which a player or players are invited by a 
company to entertain its customers, without any broadcast or other electronic portrayal of 
play and without a public gallery.
3. Guidelines for Conflicting Event Releases
 (a) Each regular member of PGA TOUR Champions shall ordinarily be eligible for two releases 
per year based on participation in 15 cosponsored or approved tournaments, and in addition 
shall be eligible for one release for every five cosponsored or approved tournaments in which 
such member participates above 15 events.
 (b) Notwithstanding the above, the Commissioner may deny any particular release request if 
he determines that such a release would cause PGA TOUR to be in violation of a contractual 
commitment to a tournament or would otherwise significantly or unreasonably harm PGA 
TOUR and such tournament. Also, the Commissioner shall be entitled, but not obligated, to 
grant additional releases when he determines that to do so would not unreasonably harm 
PGA TOUR or the tournament involved.
 (c) In making factual determinations contemplated in the preceding paragraph, the 
Commissioner shall consider, but shall not be limited to, the following factors:
 (1) The overall makeup of the field from which the member seeks to be released.
 (2) The member's standing on the Current and Previous Year's Charles Schwab Cup 
Money/ Points List.
 (3) The number of PGA TOUR Champions tournaments that the member has played in, 
or committed to play in, for the current year.
 (4) The member's record of participation in the tournament from which he seeks to be 
released.37
37 All requests for conflicting event releases must be submitted 45 days in advance. The 
Commissioner normally shall make decisions on release requests no later than 30 days in 
advance.
NOTE: No conflicting event releases will be approved for tournaments held in North America
B. MEDIA AND MARKETING RIGHTS
1. Media Rights
(a) The television, digital, radio, motion picture and all other media rights of all players 
participating in PGA TOUR cosponsored and coordinated tournaments, pro-ams or any 
other golf event conducted in conjunction with PGA TOUR cosponsored and coordinated 
tournament (e.g., clinics, long-drive contests), or any portion thereof, are hereby granted 
and assigned to PGA TOUR. Based upon this grant and assignment, all such rights shall 
be the property of and expressly reserved by and to PGA TOUR, and any use thereof 
without the express written consent of PGA TOUR shall be forbidden.
(b) No PGA TOUR member shall participate in any live or recorded golf program without 
the prior written approval of the Commissioner, except that this requirement shall not 
apply to PGA TOUR cosponsored, coordinated or approved tournaments, wholly instruc -
tional programs* or personal appearances on interview or guest shows. "Golf program" 
for purposes of this section means any golf contest, exhibition or play that is shown 
anywhere in the world in any form of media now known or hereinafter developed. The 
Commissioner's approval of any member(s) participating in any golf program covered by 
this rule may be subject, without limitation, to the sponsor, promoter, television producer 
and/or other parties involved in the golf program entering into a sanctioning or other 
agreement with PGA TOUR, including an acknowledgement of PGA TOUR's media rights 
and the payment of rights fees to PGA TOUR, therefore, and to such other conditions as 
are designated by the Commissioner.
 *While wholly instructional programs have been exempted from the scope of this rule by 
the PGA TOUR Policy Board, any PGA TOUR member participating in such a program is 
nonetheless required to obtain an agreement from the producer of the program or other 
appropriate party that the program will not be shown or distributed at the same time 
as any scheduled live coverage of a PGA TOUR cosponsored, approved or coordinated 
tournament. The "on-demand" distribution of a wholly instructional program will not 
violate this rule as long as the program is not debuted during live coverage.
2. Marketing Rights
(a)  Aside from the assignment of individual television and similar rights provided for herein, 
nothing in these Regulations or in marketing programs adopted by PGA TOUR shall be 
deemed to restrict any member's individual marketing rights (e.g., promotions, endorse -
ments, licensing, etc.).
(b)  In addition, no person shall make any commercial use of the name, likeness or identity 
of any member of PGA TOUR Champions without the advance written approval of such 
member.38
38(c)  Similarly, no individual PGA TOUR Champions member, tournament sponsor or other 
person or entity is authorized to make any commercial use of PGA TOUR Champions or 
PGA TOUR name, marks or logo without the advance written approval of PGA TOUR.39
39VI. CONDUCT OF PLAYERS
Players participating in PGA TOUR Champions cosponsored, approved or coordinated tournaments 
shall observe these Regulations and the applicable rules of play while engaged in tournament 
play, and at all times shall conduct themselves in a manner becoming professional golfers that 
will not reflect unfavorably on PGA TOUR, its members, officers or representatives, or tournament 
sponsors.
To this end, players shall use their best efforts to play golf of the caliber and with the skill befitting 
professionals, and to show respect for the game of golf.
Any player who violates any of the foregoing or any of the provisions of this Article Vl may be 
subject to a fine, suspension from play in cosponsored and coordinated tournaments, permanent 
disbarment from such play, or any appropriate combination thereof.
A. ANTI-DOPING PROGRAM
 All players shall comply with the PGA TOUR Anti-Doping Program, as amended from time to 
time.
B. PGA TOUR CHAMPIONS ALCOHOL POLICY
 Any member found to have violated any of the following provisions relating to the use of alcohol 
shall be considered to have engaged in conduct unbecoming a professional and shall be subject 
to a significant penalty:
 Consuming an alcoholic beverage during any practice round or tournament round (whether a 
pro-am round or a tournament competition round), on the practice tee or putting green.
 Moderate, responsible consumption of alcoholic beverages after play or during social func-
tions is permitted. But players should know that alcohol related unprofessional incidents will 
constitute conduct unbecoming a professional.
 A PGA TOUR member's responsibility to conduct himself in a professional manner and lend 
credit to himself and his organization extends beyond the time that the member is engag -
ing in tournament play at the tournament site. Accordingly, the Membership should be aware 
that, depending on the circumstances, being under the influence of alcohol at any time in a 
public place, whether at a tournament site or otherwise, may constitute conduct unbecoming 
a professional.
 The Commissioner will conduct such inquires and investigations as shall be appropriate to 
determine whether a member has violated the alcohol policy or any interpretations thereof.
C. INTEGRITY PROGRAM
 All contestants in PGA TOUR Champions events are subject to the terms and conditions of the 
PGA TOUR Integrity Program. The Integrity Program among other things prohibits players from 40
40betting on professional golf and engaging in other betting-related activities and requires play-
ers to complete certain educational requirements, in an effort to maintain integrity and prevent 
betting-related corruption in PGA TOUR events. The full terms of the Integrity Program may be 
found at pgatourlinks.com. Questions regarding the Integrity Program should be directed to 
Andy Levinson, Senior Vice President, Tournament Administration, at PGA TOUR Headquarters.
D. NO GUARANTEE FOR APPEARANCE
 Neither players nor other individuals acting on such players' behalf shall solicit or accept any 
compensation, gratuity or other thing of value offered for the purpose of guaranteeing their 
appearance in any PGA TOUR Champions cosponsored, coordinated or approved tournament, 
including any pro-am event played in connection therewith, except as may be specifically 
authorized by PGA TOUR Champions Division Board or PGA TOUR Policy Board prior to the 
tournament.
 Conversely, neither players nor other individuals acting on such players' behalf shall offer 
anything of value to a PGA TOUR Champions cosponsored, approved or coordinated event in 
return for an invitation to the tournament, as described in Section A.1(h) of Article III (Sponsor 
Exemptions). Notwithstanding the above, the player may agree with the tournament to offer 
his services or participation in a Monday pro-am, clinic or tournament function in conjunction 
with his sponsor exemption, and be compensated in the same manner as a player not receiving 
a Sponsor Exemption.
E. FINANCIAL INTEREST BY PLAYER IN ANOTHER PLAYER; GAMBLING; BRIBES; GIFTS; 
DOPING
 In order to ensure the competitive integrity of PGA TOUR tournaments, a player participating 
in a PGA TOUR tournament shall not have any financial interest, either direct or indirect, in 
the performance or winnings of another player in any golf event cosponsored, coordinated, 
approved or otherwise sanctioned by the PGA TOUR or any other professional golf tour, includ -
ing, without limitation, an unauthorized tournament, whether through purse-splitting, prize 
money "insurance," financial assistance, bets, team membership, team/league ownership or 
otherwise without prior written permission of the PGA TOUR. Any member who violates the 
provisions of this paragraph shall be subject to immediate suspension under Article VII. Section. 
C. Such member shall also be subject to Major Penalty under Article VII. Section E.2 of sus -
pension from tournament play for a minimum period of two seasons. Any non-member who 
violates the provisions of this paragraph shall be ineligible for PGA TOUR tournament play for a 
minimum period of two complete seasons. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Commissioner 
in their discretion may determine that there are aggravating or mitigating circumstances that 
warrants a lesser or greater penalty, as applicable.
 A player shall not do any of the following:
1.  Fail to give his best efforts in competition.
2.  Gamble or play cards on the premises where a PGA TOUR Champions cosponsored or 
coordinated tournament is being played.41
413.  Associate with or have dealings with persons whose activities, including gambling, might 
reflect adversely upon the integrity of the game of golf.
4.  Bet money or anything of value on a golf tournament or similar event, whether or not the 
player is a competitor in such competition.
5.  Offer or give a bribe, gift, payment, reward or anything of value to any player with the inten -
tion of influencing his efforts in a competition.
6.  Solicit, agree to accept or accept a bribe, gift, payment, reward or anything of value offered 
or given with the intention of influencing the player's efforts in a competition.

foregoing.
8.  Associate or have dealings with persons whose activities have involved trafficking or admin -
istration of substances or methods prohibited by the PGA TOUR Anti-Doping Program, or 
other forms of doping.
F. PUBLIC COMMENTS; PUBLIC ATTACKS
 The favorable public reputation of PGA TOUR Champions, its players and its tournaments 
are valuable assets and create tangible benefits for all PGA TOUR Champions members. 
Accordingly, it is an obligation of membership to refrain from making comments that unrea -
sonably attack or disparage others, including, but not limited to tournaments, sponsors, fellow 
members,-/players and/or PGA TOUR. Speech that could be reasonably viewed as hateful, 
abusive, obscene and/or divisive is expressly prohibited. Responsible expressions of legitimate 
disagreement with PGA TOUR policies are not prohibited. However, public comments that a 
member knows, or should reasonably know, will harm the reputation or financial best interest 
of PGA TOUR, a fellow member/player, a tournament sponsor or a charity are expressly cov -
ered by this section. Any violation of this section shall be considered conduct unbecoming a 
professional.
G. USGA RULES
 Play in all PGA TOUR Champions cosponsored or coordinated tournaments shall be conducted 
in accordance with the Rules of the United States Golf Association, as modified by PGA TOUR 
Champions. Players will be furnished a copy of such modifications, including Local Rules and 
Conditions of Competition for PGA TOUR Champions and Notice to Competitors (Players) prior 
to their starting time.
H. LATE STARTERS
 Prompt attendance is required of players at their starting point of each round. If any player 
arrives at his starting point, ready to play, within five minutes of his starting time, the penalty 
for failure to start on time is loss of the first hole in match play or two strokes in stroke play. 42
42Any player arriving at his starting point five minutes or more after his appointed starting time 
shall be disqualified.
I. PRACTICING
 Practicing shall be permitted in designated practice areas only. During practice rounds, the 
following shall govern certain types of strokes:
1.  Only one stroke, including a stroke from a bunker, may be aimed for the putting green, except 
as follows:
(a) If such stroke does not stop on the putting green, only one additional stroke may be 
played.
(b) More than one chip shot outside a bunker may be played, provided such practice does 
not damage the course unduly.
2.  Not more than three bunker strokes may be played in directions other than toward the putting 
green, provided the bunker is not thereby damaged unduly.
3.  More than one stroke may be played on the putting green. In any case, a player must not 
delay any following players. Specifically, and notwithstanding anything to the contrary 
herein, in any case in which a member of a group behind the player is waiting to hit a shot, 
no practice shots shall be permitted.
4.  During designated practice periods (i.e., Monday, Tuesday and up until the last tee time on 
the final pro-am day of tournament week) only the following are permitted to use tournament 
practice facilities (i.e., course, practice tee or practice green): (1) players in the starting field 
of the respective tournament, (2) the first six alternates from the standard priority order and 
the highest two on site alternates. Exempt PGA TOUR Champions Members (i.e., above 
the floor of 54 on Prior Year Points and/or above the floor of 100 on All-Time Money) who 
are serving as part of the talent of the television broadcaster for a specific event and are 
not otherwise in the field may utilize the tournament practice tee and practice green on a 
limited basis (i.e., during non-peak periods) during designated practice periods, subject to 
the approval of the onsite Rules Official Tournament Director.
 NOTE: No practice is permitted on the tournament course before and/or after pro-am rounds 
unless designated by Rules Official Tournament Director.
J. CADDIES AND GOLF CARTS
 Caddies must be employed by professionals for all pro-am rounds and tournament rounds. 
Caddies shall be paid promptly. PGA TOUR shall determine who is eligible to be employed as 
a caddie. Players who bring their own caddies to a PGA TOUR Champions cosponsored or 
coordinated tournament shall be responsible for the conduct and behavior of such caddies.
 Players in PGA TOUR Champions cosponsored tournaments may use automotive transportation 
as prescribed in specific golf cart policies and procedures developed by PGA TOUR Champions 
Administration under approval of PGA TOUR Champions Division Board. Certain cosponsored 43
43events, per PGA TOUR Champions Division Board approval, may expressly prohibit use of auto-
motive transportation (e.g., golf carts) for all players based on factors particular to an individual 
event (e.g., format, stature of event, etc.). However, the Rules Official Tournament Director may 
allow or disallow the use of carts in the practice rounds and pro-am as they deem necessary.
K. LOCKER ROOM FEES
 Players in the starting field of the tournament using locker room facilities at the host clubhouse 
shall pay a minimum of $50 to the locker room attendant for such service.
L. APPEARANCE OF PLAYERS
 Players shall present a neat appearance in both clothing and personal grooming. Clothing 
worn by players shall be consistent with currently accepted golf fashion. While it is difficult to 
be specific, there are certain types of attire which are clearly unacceptable. The Rules Official 
Tournament Director shall interpret this regulation, subject to the approval of the Commissioner.
M. MEASURING CONDITION OF PUTTING GREENS
 The Rules of Golf state that before a round or playoff on any day of a stroke play competition, a 
player must not practice on the competition course or test the surface of any putting green on 
the course by rolling a ball or rubbing the surface.
 The PGA TOUR has adopted the following policy which applies to PGA TOUR, PGA TOUR 
Champions and Korn Ferry Tour competitions:
 Players and caddies ARE NOT permitted to use any device that measures the condition (i.e. 
slope, speed, texture, firmness, friction or moisture level) of any putting green on the course on 
any day of a stroke play or match play competition. The use of such devices is also prohibited 
on any official practice day or during any tournament related Pro-Am competition. The use of 
training aids or any other devices is allowed on practice greens all week
 A player or caddie who does not comply with this policy is subject to disciplinary action under 
Article VII. DISCIPLINE, PENAL TIES & APPEALS, Section C: Conduct Unbecoming a Professional 
of the PGA TOUR Tournament Regulations.44
44VII. DISCIPLINE, PENALTIES AND APPEALS
Each PGA TOUR Champions member, by participating in a cosponsored, coordinated or approved 
tournament, acknowledges the right and authority of PGA TOUR Champions Division Board, the 
PGA TOUR Policy Board, the Commissioner and the Appeals Committee to: (i) fine and suspend the 
member from tournament play; and/or (ii) fine and permanently bar the member from tournament 
play in PGA TOUR Champions cosponsored, coordinated or approved tournaments for violation of 
these Tournament Regulations.
Any such participating member, if involved or affected in any manner whatsoever by a decision 
of PGA TOUR Champions Division Board, the PGA TOUR Policy Board, the Commissioner or the 
Appeals Committee with respect to any such violation, hereby releases PGA TOUR Champions 
Division Board, the PGA TOUR Policy Board, the Commissioner, the Appeals Committee, PGA 
TOUR, Inc., the Professional Golfers' Association of America and each director, officer, member, 
employee, agent or representative of any of the foregoing, jointly and severally, individually and 
in their official capacity, of and from any and all claims, demands, damages and causes of action 
whatsoever, in law or equity, arising out of or in connection with any such decision or action by PGA 
TOUR Champions Division Board, the PGA TOUR Policy Board, the Commissioner or the Appeals 
Committee.
Fines are due and payable within 30 days unless the player has made a written appeal. Should 
the appeal be denied, the fine will be due and payable within 30 days of such denial of appeal, 
and notwithstanding such 30-day period, until such fine is paid the member will be ineligible for 
competition.
A. NOTIFICATION OF DISCIPLINARY INQUIRY
 Except for penalties under the USGA Rules of Golf (including Pace of Play, Local Rules and 
Conditions of Competition for PGA TOUR Champions), and for minor penalties, any member 
subject to disciplinary action or penalty defined as an intermediate or major penalty shall first 
be notified of such proposed action in writing. Such notice may be presented to the member 
by the President or his designee, except that any notice of a proposed major penalty shall be 
executed by the Commissioner.
 Within 14 days of such notice of proposed disciplinary action or penalty, the member shall 
submit to the Commissioner such facts or evidence of mitigating circumstances as may apply.
 Within 14 days of receipt of such information from the member, the Commissioner shall notify 
the member in writing of the imposition of the proposed disciplinary action or penalty, or that 
the proposed action has been dismissed. After imposition of any penalty hereunder, the member 
shall have the right of appeal as set forth in Section E of this Article VII.
B. USGA RULES OF GOLF
 Any member who, while participating in any PGA TOUR Champions cosponsored, coordinated 
or approved tournament, breaches the USGA Rules of Golf, Local Rules and Conditions of 
competition for PGA TOUR Champions or Local Rules or Conditions in effect for the conduct of 45
45such tournament shall be subject to the penalties provided in such Rules or Conditions, as well 
as any other penalties determined by PGA TOUR Champions Division Board and/or PGA TOUR 
Policy Board. The decision of PGA TOUR Champions Rules Committee for the tournament with 
respect to such breach(es) shall be final and conclusive.
 NOTE: Pace of Play rules constitute supplemental local rules.
C. CONDUCT UNBECOMING A PROFESSIONAL
 Any member who shall be deemed guilty of conduct unbecoming a professional golfer while 
participating in a PGA TOUR Champions cosponsored, coordinated or approved tournament, 
or activities related thereto (e.g., practice rounds, hospitality events, etc.), or who otherwise 
violates the provisions of Articles VI, Article VII or Article IX, Section E.1 (Annual Mandatory 
Meeting) of these Regulations shall be subject to fine, suspension and/or permanent disbar -
ment from tournament play as provided in these Regulations.
 In any instance where a PGA TOUR Champions member has for any reason been placed on pro -
bation for an infraction of any rule of PGA TOUR, then and in that event, if at any time during the 
probation period that member shall violate any rule of PGA TOUR, irrespective of whether that 
violation carries with it a penalty designated minor, intermediate or major as described under 
Article VII, Sections D.1-3, the Commissioner may immediately suspend the member's playing 
privileges. In addition, if there are credible allegations of serious criminal misconduct, violations 
that compromise the integrity of competition and/or the financial interest of the PGA TOUR, the 
Commissioner may immediately suspend a player pending the outcome of an investigation by 
TOUR and/or determination through an appropriate criminal or civil proceeding. Such serious 
criminal misconduct includes, but is not limited to, child abuse and other offenses involving 
minors, domestic violence, human trafficking, sexual assault, and/or any reckless conduct that 
results in serious mental or bodily injury to another.
 A suspension imposed by the Commissioner under this Section C. is separate from any penalty 
under Section E. and, therefore, is not stayed during any appeal under Section E and shall remain 
in effect until such time the Commissioner has informed the member of the decision to revoke 
the suspension.
 Prior to imposition of any minor, intermediate, or major penalty (except under the Rules of Golf), 
the player shall be notified orally, if possible, and in writing signed by the Commissioner, PGA 
TOUR Champions President, or his designee (in case of intermediate penalty). Such written 
notifications shall specify the precise charges or violations. To the extent practicable, such 
written notifications shall be given within seven days following such violation.
 Any written notification required by this Section to be given to a member shall be hand- delivered 
or sent to him via registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, or guaranteed overnight 
delivery service to the address of the player as shown in the records of PGA TOUR, provided 
that delivery to a player's locker at a tournament site shall constitute hand delivery under this 
Section.46
46D. CLASSES OF PENALTIES
1. Minor Penalties
 A minor penalty is a fine of not more than $2,500. A minor penalty may be imposed by the 
President of PGA TOUR Champions or his designee.
2. Intermediate Penalties
 An intermediate penalty is a fine of between $2,501 and $5,000 and/or suspension from 
play for not more than three tournaments, including the tournament then in progress or 
scheduled for the calendar week in which the alleged violation occurred. An intermediate 
penalty may be imposed by the Commissioner or, if the Commissioner is not readily avail -
able, by the President of PGA TOUR Champions.
3. Major Penalties
 A major penalty is a fine in excess of $5,000, suspension from tournament play for more 
than three tournaments, and/or permanent disbarment from tournament play in PGA TOUR 
or PGA TOUR Champions cosponsored or coordinated events. A major penalty may be 
imposed only by the Commissioner, except as otherwise specified in these Regulations.
E. APPEALS
1. Minor Penalties
 Appeals from minor penalties shall be to the President of PGA TOUR Champions or his 
designee. Such appeal may be written or oral, and may include defenses or mitigating 
circumstances, including written statements of witnesses. Such appeal shall be received 
by the President of PGA TOUR Champions or his designee no later than 14 days after the 
date of the written notification of imposition of the penalty. The President of PGA TOUR 
Champions or his designee shall render his decision on appeal, in writing, within 14 days of 
his receipt of the appeal, and such decision shall be final.
2. Intermediate and Major Penalties
 Within 14 days of the date of notification of an intermediate or major penalty, the member 
may submit a written appeal to the Commissioner; provided, however, that if the initial pen-
alty was imposed by the Commissioner and the Commissioner deems it in the best interest 
of PGA TOUR, any appeal to the Commissioner may be transferred by the Commissioner to 
the Appeals Committee. Such appeal may include statements from others having knowl -
edge of the facts. Failure to file such an appeal shall be deemed conclusively to be an 
admission of the charges specified in the notification.
 Thereafter, and within 14 days of receipt of such appeal, the Commissioner shall reach a 
decision and shall promptly notify the member in writing of his response, specifying the 
reason therein. No member who has not appealed an intermediate or major penalty to the 
Commissioner shall have a right of further appeal to the Appeals Committee.
 An appeal shall operate to stay the effective date of any penalty, except suspension from a 
tournament then in progress or scheduled for the calendar week in which the alleged viola -
tion occurred, until after the final decision on the appeal. However, no appeal as set forth 47
47in this Section E.2. shall operate to stay a suspension imposed by the Commissioner on a 
member under Section C.
3. Appeals Committee
 There shall be an Appeals Committee consisting of the Chairman of the PGA TOUR 
Champions Division Board (or another Independent Director designated by the Chairman), 
the Immediate Past President of the PGA of America (or another Independent Director des-
ignated by the Chairman), and a former professional tournament golfer from time to time 
designated by PGA TOUR Champions Division Board to serve on such committee.
 The Appeals Committee shall have power to fix the time and place of any hearing to review 
decisions and shall prescribe its own rules of procedure.
 A member may appeal to the Appeals Committee from any decision by the Commissioner 
denying any initial appeal from the imposition of any penalty. The Appeals Committee also 
shall consider any appeal which the Commissioner has elected not to hear as described 
in Article VII, Section E.2. The appellant shall give written notice of appeal, directed to the 
Appeals Committee (in care of the Commissioner) within 14 days of the date of the notice 
from the Commissioner denying the player's initial appeal.
 Within 14 days of receipt of the notice of appeal, the Appeals Committee shall review the 
decision of the Commissioner. If the penalty imposed involves suspension from play in a 
tournament or tournaments other than one then in progress or scheduled for the calendar 
week in which the alleged violation occurred, upon request of the appellant made at the 
time of taking the appeal, the Appeals Committee shall permit the appellant to be heard in 
person or by attorney, and to present witnesses. The Appeals Committee may call witnesses 
to assist it in determining the appeal. The member shall not be entitled to a hearing before 
the Appeals Committee with respect to imposition of a fine, but he may submit to the com-
mittee written statements in defense or mitigation.
 In any case where the appellant shall be entitled to and has timely requested a hearing 
before the Appeals Committee, the Appeals Committee may, by unanimous agreement of 
its members, appoint a special Hearing Officer to conduct the hearing. The Hearing Officer 
shall be a lawyer and shall have a knowledge of golf and the USGA Rules of Golf. Promptly 
after his appointment, he shall fix the time(s) and place(s) for the hearing, and he is autho-
rized to prescribe the rules of procedure for such hearing and to call witnesses to assist 
in determining the issues. As soon as reasonably practicable after the completion of the 
hearing, the Hearing Officer shall prepare a report setting forth his findings of fact and shall 
transmit the same, together with the stenographic transcript of the hearing (if any), to the 
Appeals Committee, and contemporaneously shall serve copies of such report upon the 
appellant and the Commissioner.
 The appellant and the Commissioner shall have 14 days from the date of submission of such 
report to the Appeals Committee to file written memoranda with the committee, excepting 
to or in support of the report and the findings, in whole or in part.
 Upon the evidence before it, including any evidence theretofore submitted to the 
Commissioner, and upon consideration of the report of the Hearing Officer and the 48
48memoranda in support or in opposition thereto (if there be such report and memoranda), 
the Appeals Committee may affirm, modify (increase or decrease) or reverse the decision 
of the Commissioner.

 The provisions of this Article shall not be applicable to violations of the PGA TOUR Anti-Doping 
Program.49

nament's performance of its financial obligations under the Tournament Agreement.50

AUTOGRAPH GUIDELINES
As a matter of policy established by PGA TOUR Champions Division Board, players are asked to 
sign autographs only before or after a round on official tournament days.
TOURNAMENT COURTESY VEHICLES
Many host organizations on PGA TOUR Champions generously provide a courtesy vehicle for 
player's use throughout the tournament week. While the PGA TOUR has developed a specific set 
of Guidelines for these Tournament Vehicles, concerns regarding liability and the condition in which 
the vehicles are returned have led to a necessary revision to these guidelines.
 Courtesy vehicles are limited to players registered in the tournament
 Each player must sign a Courtesy Vehicle Agreement/ Driver Conduct Requirements Form
 Players must be 21 years old to drive a courtesy vehicle
 Only the player or his spouse are considered authroized drivers, and spouses must also sign 
the Tournament Courtesy Vehicle Form if the player elects to have his spouse drive the vehicle
 If a player does not meet the driver qualifications or driver criteria, he may designate a qualified 
assigned driver to drive the vehicle on behalf of the player, that assigned driver must be over the 
age of 25 and must sign the Courtesy Vehicle Agreement/ Driver Conduct Requirements Form
 Upon receiving the courtesy vehicle, the physical condition and cleanliness is the player's 
responsibility, and he should conduct a pre- and post- inspection of the vehicle.
 If the vehicle is returned with physical damage or gross uncleanliness, documentation will be 
noted and reported to the PGA TOUR Risk Management team
 Players who fail to adhear to these guidelines may lose their courtesy vehicle priveledges
 Players may be responsible for damage to the courtesy vehicle
Understanding that individual tournament circumstances may impact distribution, the following is 
provided only as a guideline for distribution to PGA TOUR Champions professionals:761. Top 36 available players from Previous Year Points List

DEFENDING CHAMPION OBLIGATION/MEDIA FUNCTIONS
As a matter of policy established by PGA TOUR Champions Division Board, the defending cham -
pion of an event is required to assist the tournament in promoting the next year's event by attend -
ing a media function (press conference, luncheon, etc.) scheduled at the mutual convenience of 
the player and tournament or, also with the mutual agreement of the player and tournament, an 
alternate promotion (e.g., title sponsor visit, play in two pro-ams, telephone conference with local 
media, tape a promotional video, etc.). The tournament will provide the player with travel and 
related expenses.
PACE OF PLAY GUIDELINES
"The player must play without undue delay and in accordance with any pace of play guidelines 
that the Committee may establish." The following pace of play guidelines, penalties and fines, for 
stroke play competitions have been adopted. In the administration of these pace of play guidelines, 
a member of the Rules Committee shall not tolerate abuse, oral or otherwise, by a player. Such 
abuse may constitute conduct unbecoming a professional.
DEFINITION OF "OUT OF POSITION"
The first group to start will be considered out of position if, at any time during the round, they exceed 
the time allotted to play, as detailed on the applicable course's Pace of Play Chart.
Any subsequent group will be considered out of position if, at any time during the round, they (a) 
exceed the allotted time to play and (b) reach a par-3 hole that is open and free of play, reach a 
par-4 hole and have not played a stroke from the teeing ground before the hole is open and free of 
play, or reach a par-5 hole and all players have not played a stroke from the teeing ground before 
the hole is open and free of play.
NOTE: The Committee reserves the right to time a group when the Committee deems it necessary. 
Further, if a player is determined by the Rules Committee to be unreasonably slow, he may be timed 
individually at the Rules Committee's discretion, regardless of whether his group is out of position.77TIMING
When the Rules Committee determines that a group is starting to fall behind, or is just out of posi -
tion, the group will receive a warning. Such warning will be given as soon as possible, and given 
only once during a round. In some circumstances, the Rules Committee may commence timing 
without having given such a warning, including when a group has already fallen significantly behind 
and/or is affecting other groups.
Once a group has been warned, the Rules Committee (if available to do so) will monitor the pace of 
individual players in the group to determine if any players should be timed individually, as opposed 
to the entire group, in the case the group does not regain its position on the course.
When the Rules Committee determines that a group or an individual out of position will be timed, 
all players in the group, or the specific individual, will be informed they are being timed. Such timing 
could occur on any hole, including the finishing holes of a round, and as soon as the next hole after 
a warning has been given.
Other than on the putting green, the timing of a player's stroke will begin when it is his turn to play 
and he can play without interference or distraction. Time spent determining yardage will count as 
time taken for the next stroke. On the putting green, timing will begin after a player has been allowed 
a reasonable amount of time to mark, lift, clean and replace his ball, repair his ball mark and other 
ball marks on his line of play and remove loose impediments on his line of play.
NOTE: A player is permitted 40 seconds to play a stroke, and an extra 10 seconds (for a total of 50 
seconds) will be allowed for:
 (a) the first player to play a stroke on a par-3 hole;
 (b) the first player to play a second stroke on a par-4 or par-5 hole;
 (c) the first player to play a third stroke on a par-5 hole;
 (d) the first player to play around the putting green;
 (e) the first player to play on the putting green.
Any player in a group being timed, who exceeds the applicable time to play a stroke, will be informed 
as soon as practicable.
PENALTIES DURING ROUND
First Offense: One (1) timing exceeding the applicable time to play a stroke (1 bad time) - no penalty.
Second Offense: One more timing (total of two) exceeding the applicable time to play a stroke (2 
bad times) - a one (1) stroke penalty.
Third Offense: One more timing (total of three) exceeding the applicable time to play a stroke (3 
bad times) - a two (2) stroke penalty.
Fourth Offense: One more timing (total of four) exceeding the applicable time to play a stroke (4 
bad times) - disqualification.
NOTE: Any timing exceeding the applicable time to play a stroke (bad time) will be carried over 
throughout the round.
FINES CUMULATIVE DURING SEASON
First Offense: First timing exceeding the applicable time to play a stroke (1 bad time) - no fine.78Second Offense: Second timing exceeding the applicable time to play a stroke (2 bad times) - a 
fine of $2,500.
Third and Subsequent Offenses: Third and subsequent timings exceeding the applicable time to 
play a stroke (3 or more bad times) - a fine of $5,000 for each offense.
NOTE 1:  Timings exceeding the applicable time to play a stroke (bad times) will accumulate 
throughout the season.
NOTE 2:  Timings exceeding the applicable time to play a stroke (bad times) on PGA TOUR 
Champions; PGA TOUR; and Korn Ferry Tour will be counted together for the purposes of deter -
mining the cumulative number of timings exceeding the applicable time to play a stroke during a 
season. Fines will be pro-rated based on the number of occurrences on each respective tour.
NOTE 3: Timings exceeding the applicable time to play a stroke (bad times) at Major Championships 
and official money World Golf Championships will be counted for the purposes of determining 
the cumulative number of timings exceeding the applicable time to play a stroke during a season.
TIMINGS CUMULATIVE DURING SEASON
First through Ninth Offense: First through ninth occasion of being out of position and timed - no 
fine.
Tenth Offense: Tenth occasion of being out of position and timed - a fine of $10,000.
Eleventh and Subsequent Offenses: Eleventh and subsequent occasion of being out of position 
and timed - a fine of $2,500 for each offense.
NOTE 1: Timings will accumulate throughout the season.
NOTE 2: Timings which occur on PGA TOUR Champions; PGA TOUR; and Korn Ferry Tour will be 
counted together for the purposes of determining the cumulative number of timings during a 
season. Fines will be pro-rated based on the number of occurrences on each respective tour.
NOTE 3: Timings which occur at Major Championships and official money World Golf Championships 
will be counted for the purposes of determining the cumulative number of timings during a season.
REPEAT OFFENSES
Any player that receives a fine under this policy for either cumulative number of timings exceeding 
the applicable time to play a stroke in a season or cumulative number of timings in a season will 
be subject to double the existing fine structure the following season. For each consecutive season 
beyond one season in which the player is subject to fines under the policy, the fine amount will 
continue to double from the previous season.
In addition, a player who exceeds ten occasions of being timed in more than one season may 
be subject to sanction under the Conduct Unbecoming a Professional regulation, including but 
not limited to suspension and/or other measures designed to help the player improve his pace 
of play including mandatory education, changes in groupings category, additional fines or other 
requirements.
APPEALS
Any appeal of a penalty and fine must be referred to the on-site Rules Official Tournament 
Director immediately upon completion of the player in question's round. The On-site Rules Official 
Tournament Director's decision shall be final. If the player in question does not appeal immediately 
upon conclusion of his round, any penalties and fines shall stand.
NOTE: A player may not appeal an occasion of being out of position and timed.79PLAYER EQUIPMENT
To help ensure that players competing in PGA TOUR Champions cosponsored and coordinated tour -
naments use equipment which conforms with the USGA Rules of Golf, players are encouraged to:
1. Confirm with equipment manufacturers that new equipment or samples have been submitted 
to and have been approved by the USGA prior to putting them into play.
2. Confirm that driving clubs are listed on the USGA Conforming Driver List. Any modified clib head 
or club face must conformas if new and may need to be re-tested.
3. Have any altered or unusual clubs checked by a PGA TOUR Champions Rules Official before 
tournament use.
4. Verify that their ball is on the USGA's Conforming Golf Balls list.
5. Confirm that clubs conform to Model Local Rule G-2, regarding groove and punch mark specifi -
cations and are listed on the USGA Equipment Database. The Exception does not apply.
If a player fails to submit his equipment prior to competition, he assumes all risk of a ruling that 
such equipment does not conform with the USGA Rules of Golf. Additionally, if required by a PGA 
TOUR Champions official, a player is obligated to surrender any equipment, if it is determined that 
additional off-site testing is necessary to rule on conformity. Failure to do so will result in disciplin -
ary action. From time to time, PGA TOUR Champions, at the request of the USGA, collects ball and 
club samples on-site for testing by the USGA.
PLAYER IDENTIFICATION
PGA TOUR Champions members will receive a personal photo ID, and family credentials which 
serve as identification at all cosponsored tournaments. In addition, a player will receive a personal 
money clip. However, the money clip will not be recognized as a credential at PGA TOUR Champions 
cosponsored events.
TICKETS FOR MEMBER'S FAMIL Y
As is specified in PGA TOUR's contracts with tournament sponsors, the sponsor will provide daily 
admission credentials without charge to any member of PGA TOUR Champions or the PGA of 
America. Family who have not been issued a year-long credential, must accompany the player in 
person to obtain a weekly credential.
SOCIAL FUNCTIONS
As a matter of policy established by PGA TOUR Champions Division Board, all PGA TOUR Champions 
members are encouraged to attend at least one social function (i.e., pro-am draw party; pro-am 
awards dinner) during any tournament played. Reasonable participation and cooperation is 
expected.
SUSPENSION OF PLAY PROCEDURES
Model Local Rule J-1 is in effect as follows:
A. Immediate Suspension (Dangerour Situation): On Prolonged note of the air horn.80B. Normal Suspension (Non-Dangerous Sutuation): Three short notes of the air horn.
C. Resume Play: Two short notes of the air horn
NOTE: All practice areas shall be closed during suspension for dangerous weather until the com-
mittee has declared them open for use.
BAD WEATHER GUIDELINES (72/54 HOLE EVENTS)
For implementation at Regions Tradition, Kaulig Companies Championship, Dominion Energy 
Charity Classic, Simmons Bank Championship and Charles Schwab Cup Championship, the fol -
lowing Bad Weather Guidelines will be utilized by PGA TOUR Champions Rules Official Tournament 
Director in the decision making process:
1. The first priority will be the completion of 72/54 holes. Every effort will be made to finish each 
round as scheduled by Sunday.
2. In order to make every effort to achieve this objective by Sunday, the Rules Official Tournament 
Director is provided the discretion to extend any day's play beyond the standard 18 hole round.
3. If conditions exist which prevent 72/54 holes from being completed by Sunday, play will always 
be extended to Monday if golf course conditions and weather forecast permit.
4. If conditions exist which make the completion of 72/54 holes impossible, the next priority is 
to complete 54 holes. Again, play in this situation will always be extended to Monday if course 
conditions and weather permit.
5. If conditions exist which make the completion of 54 holes impossible, the next priority is to 
complete 36 holes, so that the winner is credited with an official victory.
6. In the event of a suspension during a Monday final round, the completion of the tournament 
shall not be extended to Tuesday, except that if at least half the field has completed play prior to 
postponement or if a playoff is necessary to determine the tournament winner. Notwithstanding 
the above, if at least half the field has not completed play prior to the postponement, play shall 
not be resumed unless, in the judgment of the Rules Official Tournament Director, the entire 
field can reasonably be expected to complete the Monday round.
EVENT QUALIFYING REDUCTION/CANCELLATION
Every effort will be made to complete the Event Qualifying competition. If Event Qualifying is con-
tested on Monday of tournament week, the competition may be extended to Tuesday if (1) the golf 
course is still available, and (2) if the Event Qualifier is conducted on the Tournament Course, in 
the judgment of the onsite Rules Official Tournament Director, continuation of the competition will 
not disrupt previously planned onsite events (e.g., Shoot-Outs, Skins Games, etc.) or unreasonably 
interfere with practice rounds for exempt players. If the Event Qualifying is contested on Tuesday 
of tournament week, no extension of the competition to Wednesday is permissible.
If, in the judgment of the onsite Rules Official Tournament Director, circumstances do not permit 
the Event Qualifying competition to be continued, the following reduction/cancellation guidelines 
approved by PGA TOUR Champions Division Board shall be applied:
1. Reduction of Play -In order for entry into the tournament to be based on competition, all 
players in the starting field of the Event Qualifying competition shall complete at least nine 
or eighteen holes. In the occurrence of a nine hole event, or eighteen hole event where a 81playoff is required, where the field has started on one tee, the available Event Qualifying 
spots shall be determined by nine-hole scores, with ties for last available spot and alternate 
priority determined via on-course playoff. If conditions dictate that there can be no on-course 
playoff, any ties for last place and priority of alternates will be determined by retrogression 
of the scorecards starting with the ninth or eighteenth and final hole and working backwards 
to the first hole, as necessary.
If the field starts on both the 1st and 10th holes and all players complete at least nine holes prior 
to the suspension of play, 1 player that started from the 1st tee (front nine) and 1 player from the 
10th tee (back nine), determined by lowest nine hole scores on the respective nines, shall be the 
successful qualifiers. Ties for last available spot(s) determined via on-course playoff. If condi -
tions dictate that there can be no on-course playoff, any ties for last place will be determined by 
retrogression of the scorecards starting with the ninth or eighteenth and final hole and working 
backwards, as necessary. Between January 1 - June 30: The 3rd and final position will be awarded 
to the highest ranking player from the Previous Year's Charles Schwab Cup Points List. If the Event 
Qualifier falls between July 1 - November 30, the 3rd and final position will be awarded to the player 
with the highest ranking Charles Schwab Current Money.
NOTE:  In the event the Pre-Qualifier field starts on the 1st and 10th holes and cannot complete a full 
18 holes of play (but did complete at least 9), the top three players from each side will advance to the 
Event Qualifier (even if it was determined there were 5 spots available prior to the competition). Ties 
for last available spot(s) determined via on-course playoff. If conditions dictate that there can be

golf bag or golf equipment a display of a political message or endorsement of a political candidate. 
Further, the following addresses categories of special concern:
Competing Tours. In order to protect the financial interest of the membership as a whole, and so 
not as to allow others to freeride on the PGA TOUR's platform, no player may display on his person,

ucts (including, starting March 1, 2019, cigars and tobacco smoked in pipes), smokeless tobacco 
products (including e-cigarettes and vaping products) and marijuana products (recreational and 
medicinal). However, a player may make appearances for any such company as long as the appear -
ances are private and not promoted or covered publicly. Players with existing sponsorships by com -

which could include a minimum fine equal to the amount of compensation received and suspension 
from tournament play.
