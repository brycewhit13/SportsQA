# Sports Rule Clarification

## Problem

In the most popular sports leagues (NFL, NHL, FIFA, etc.) there can be hundreds of pages in the rulebook
that players, coaches, and referees are expected to follow. The average fan doesnâ€™t read or remember
the entire rulebook and if they have a question about the rules, they need to parse through hundreds of
pages to find an answer. These pages are dense and contain lots of jargon as they are designed to cover
every situation that may happen in a game. This lawyer-like precision adds a lot of information that is
simply unnecessary for 95% of fans. On top of this, the rules are constantly updating each year and it can
be very difficult to keep track of everything.

## Solution

The goal of this project is to create a web application where people can go and have all their questions about the current rules in sports answered. Through interacting with a chatbot, users can ask any questions about the rules and they will get a response that summarizes what the rule is and how it is enforced. The goal is to have a simple response that gives the main points without all the jargon from the rulebook.

Support is currently available for the current sports and leagues:

- American Football (NFL)
- Hockey (NHL)
- Basketball (NBA and WNBA)
- Cricket (ICC)
- Ultimate (USAU)
